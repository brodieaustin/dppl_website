       Large Type Books and Audiobooks
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The library offers a wide variety of large type books and audiobooks. Large type books are set in print that makes reading easier for some individuals. Audiobooks, both on cassette and compact disc, are either abridged (a shortened version) or unabridged (the entire book). These materials are on the third floor. For assistance, call the Readers' Services Desk at 847-376-2840.
