      </strong>

      <strong>
       My test needs to be taken online. Can you help me?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Yes. The computers for adults (over 15) are on the fourth floor. You can stop in at any time and we will get you on a computer. We can only sign you up for an hour: if you need more time, ask the Reference staff.

      <strong>
       I have a paper test. How does that work?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      We can book a private study room on the fourth floor for you. Call or email Gwen LaCosse to do so (see above). The library staff cannot stay in the room with you, but they will check on you every so often during the exam period.
