      <p>
        Everyone has one. We contribute to our own every day. When we read, we are affected by other people's stories. At the Des Plaines Public Library, our book groups are a forum for readers to share how books reflect and shape their own stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        One group meets every month on the first Tuesday at 10.00 am. Another one meets the second Thursday of the month at 7.30pm. Book groups meet in the Rotary Heritage Room on the 3rd floor.

         Books are always available one month prior at the Readers' Services Desk, 3rd floor.
