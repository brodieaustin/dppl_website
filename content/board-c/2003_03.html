Over 75 staff members attended. Our goal was for all staff to learn a few welcoming phrases so well that we would lose our natural shyness about speaking to people who speak Spanish. This class was funded by one of the three grants we received through the State Library this year.            </p>            <p>              Our quarterly All-Staff Meeting on March 13 was planned to inform staff members about safety and security concerns and procedures in light of the national emergency warning system and recent incidents that have caught the attention of our police department. Police personnel made suggestions and answered questions. We also learned about several exciting events coming up in the next few months, including the grant program celebrating other cultures and the summer reading activities.            </p>            <p>              The Reclassification Committee has begun its work by examining all surveys and job descriptions.

Without a publicity campaign other than stories in two local newspapers, all classes fill as soon as the openings occur. Each class holds eleven students, with an average of six classes per week. Classes in Spanish and Polish are also planned. The evaluations of these classes have been uniformly positive.            </p>            <p>              Circulation, registration, and patron count all showed healthy increases over 2002 totals. Library card holders represent 76% of the population of Des Plaines. Our patron count in February averaged 1700+ per day. We introduced a computerized reservation service for internet and computer lab use on Monday, March 10. Staff reports that after working out a few bugs on the first day, the new system is working well. Not all patrons have embraced this as an improvement over the manual, clipboard system. Self-check use is holding at 22% of all circulations from the main library. We are noticing the decline in circulation of periodicals and cassette formats and the increase in DVD circulation.            </p>            <h3>              PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES            </h3>            <p>              Since the February Board meeting I have attended the following meetings: Library Cable Network Executive Committee, which I chair, the first year report of the Illinois Library Leadership Initiative in Springfield, IL, several Do the Dewy committee meetings, two meetings of the Planning Committee, Hola Amigos!, a lecture by Mary Minow on the USAPATRIOTACT at the Chicago Public Library, the Library Directors workgroup, the Chamber City Advisory Committee breakfast, the Socrates Rand Awards Banquet, the Library Community Foundation Fund Partners breakfast meeting, and SLURP.            </p>            <h2>              OLD BUSINESS            </h2>            <p>              Sandra Norlin reported on the upcoming fundraiser, &quot;Do the Dewey&quot;.
