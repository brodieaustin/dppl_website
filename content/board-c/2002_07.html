President John Ciborowski called the meeting to order at 7:01 PM.            </p>            <h2>              PUBLIC COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS            </h2>            <p>              Terry Murphy from the Society of Children&#39;s Book Writers and Illustrators asked for Board approval to hold monthly meetings at the library. Terry explained that the group meets one time per month for two hours on Saturday mornings and that Illinois Chapter is insured. President Ciborowski referred to the Public Meeting Room Use Policy which states that the priorities for meeting room use are library -sponsored programs and meetings, meetings of nonprofit Des Plaines Community groups or organizations whose aims are educational, cultural, or civic in nature and meetings of other nonprofit groups the majority of whose members are residents of Des Plaines. Karen Rhine, a member of the group, is a resident of Des Plaines. Eldon Burk stated that any library or community special events would take priority over any outside meetings. The Board advised Terry Murphy that the meeting room request would be added to the agenda as New Business.            </p>            <p>              Sue D&#39;Hondt, President of the Friends of the Library, reported that the Friends will hold their next used booksale October 18 - 20. Sue also reported that the Friends are considering purchasing new audio equipment for library meeting room use. Sue reported that a donation from the Janet Evans Memorial Fund has paid for framing the historical photographs that will hang in the Rotary Heritage Room. Inara Brubaker asked Sue D&#39;Hondt if the Friends would financially support the installation of a wrought iron fence to be installed between the train station and the library and Sue responded that after reviewing the Friends Charter, that this is not a Friends function.            </p>            <p>              Susan Burrows stated that at the July 15, 2002 City Council meeting, the Council discussed adopting a 3.75% telecommunication tax. Susan stated that this tax would be a burden on the library.            </p>            <h2>              CONSENT AGENDA            </h2>            <p>              Noreen Lake asked that VI.-A., Approval of the Minutes of the Regular Board Meeting - June 18, 2002, VI.-B., Acceptance of Financial Reports for June, 2002 and VI.-C., Approval of Library Expenditures be removed from the Consent Agenda.            </p>            <p>              Noreen Lake asked that the minutes of the June 18, 2002 meeting be changed from 911 to 9/11.            </p>            <p>              Noreen Lake asked why Over the Counter Receipts for 2002 are less than 2001. Martha Sloan responded that the library has not made any changes to the way over the counter receipts are collected, but will research the matter and report back to the Board. Rhys Read stated that printers are very reasonable and that patrons previously using the library&#39;s copy machines may now print their items at home. Hector Marino stated that fewer copies are being made at the library. Noreen Lake responded that this reduction in library income should be considered during budget discussions. Noreen Lake also stated that in Fund 2130, Illinois Library Per Capita Grant, the line item 960070, Auto/Travel Expenses is over budget. Martha Sloan responded that library staff has attended most major conferences already and Rhys Read stated that the line items will balance out.            </p>            <p>              Following monthly reports to be reviewed and placed on file for audit:            </p>            <div align="left">              <table width="75%" border="0">                <tr>                  <td>                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                  </td>                  <td>                    1.
