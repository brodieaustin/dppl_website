Sandra also stated that vermin and insect problems are a consideration. John Ciborowski agreed that food odor may be offensive to other library patrons and staff.

The increase of nearly 50% in attendance (year to date) at the library is remarkable and has a concomitant effect in all public service points. Staff who handle telephone inquiries, registrations, directional questions, reference questions, computer assistance and signups, activities associated with circulating and returning materials, and interlibrary loan have all performed well to keep up with this increased demand for their attention and assistance.                        </p>                        <p>                            Several programs deserve special mention in this report. The summer reading clubs for both adults and youth have very healthy participation. The programming for teens is especially strong, with a growing number of participants and a growing enthusiasm for the activities among the participants. The Teen Poetry Night is an excellent example of this. Partnerships have produced excellent and well-attended programs this month as well. We cooperated with Oakton Community College to present a portion of Bluestem Festival programming at the library, concluding with a performance of the Northwest Symphony Orchestra. The Family Heritage Festival was presented at the library, planned by the Historical Museum Staff, and very well attended by the public. And, our Fourth of July parade entry helped to make our presence known by all Independence Day celebrants.                        </p>                        <p>                            Summer Reading Club registration and activities are very strong as well.

The suggested questions included "How was the service?" "Did you find what you were looking for?" Susan Burrows stated that there has been an increase in attendance at the library with a staff that has not grown with the attendance.                        </p>                        <p>                            Sue D'Hondt asked for additional signage for the next Friends book sale.                        </p>                        <h2>                            NEW BUSINESS                        </h2>                        <p>                            William Grice asked for Board approval to change the Board's meeting time to 7:00 PM instead of 7:30 PM.                        </p>                        <p>                            MOTION by Rhys Read, seconded by Susan Burrows, to approve the regular monthly Board of Library Trustees meeting dates for the period August 2001 through July 2002 and to change the meeting time to 7:00 PM.

Eldon Burk responded that the library meetings could be taped at the library with a delayed broadcast time, but that cost of the tapings would be a consideration. The Board consensus was to continue to have their meetings at the library, but to continue to explore other options. President Burk appointed a Committee to review the options available to the library regarding broadcasting their meetings. President Burk appointed William Grice, Susan Burrows and John Ciborowski to the Committee.
