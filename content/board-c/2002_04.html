Sandra explained that a program for library trustees will be presented on Saturday, September 28 from 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. Interested Board members should register by notifying Carol Kidd by July 1 to take advantage of a discount.            </p>            <p>              Noreen Lake asked that the minutes of the Building and Grounds be changed to the following:            </p>            <p>              3. Brick Removal/Replacement -<br />              Committee discussed the advisability of moving and/or turning around bricks under the lights. The committee members walked out to the Plaza to view the bricks, after which they agreed that Eldon Burk, Susan Burrows and Noreen Lake would meet with the brick installer before bricks are removed and replaced in the Plaza to clarify some questions and to indicate where they would like to have the new bricks placed.            </p>            <h2>              ADMINISTRATOR&#39;S REPORT            </h2>            <p>              New employees for March/April are Joe Mullarkey and Elizabeth Steffensen, part-time Librarians in Adult Services.            </p>            <p>              Departing employees are Bobby Palmero and Justin Ashcroft.            </p>            <p>              The staff has been engaged in a job-shadowing project, under the grant for staff development. Each employee is required to &quot;shadow&quot; in another department for at least two hours. The assignment for shadowing is to gain understanding of the inner workings and activities of another department and to increase understanding of how each job is related to others in the library. The grant is being administered by Martha Sloan, who is working with Consultant Mary Jane Kepner. They have formed a committee to plan events leading up to and including the Staff In-Service Day on May 9. The grant will also cover most of the expenses for the In-Service, with the exception of food, which is covered in the library&#39;s operating budget.            </p>            <p>              While the increase in circulation for the month of March is not as high as we have been experiencing, it is important to note that the increase from March 2000 to March 2001 was 14%. Patron attendance remains high and is increasing.            </p>            <p>              Julianne Dennison, Grant Coordinator for the Residents and Retailers Grant has collected information from surveys and has conducted focus groups to obtain suggestions for services to the growing residential and business population in the library&#39;s new neighborhood. She will present a preliminary report at the April Board Meeting.            </p>            <p>              I represented the Des Plaines Public Library on a panel on &quot;Best Practices&quot; in library services to multilingual populations at the Illinois State Library System Directors and Advisory Committee meeting in Springfield on March 21. I attend the UI Extension Advisory Committee meeting on March 22, the Chamber City Advisory Breakfast on March 26. I met with the Mayor and Chloe Golden (Mayor for a Day) and her father on March 26. I attended the meeting of the Board Building and Grounds and Planning Committees on March 26, and a CCS Governing Board Meeting on March 27. On March 28 I met with the librarian of De Paul University&#39;s branch campuses to discusses cooperative activities and taped three segments, along with Holly Sorensen, Roberta Johnson, and Sarah Long, of the &quot;Check-in @ Your Library &quot; series on Library Cable Network. One of the segments may be picked up by ALA to use in their ongoing @Your Library campaign. I attended a Public Library Administrators Forum on March 29. The topics for discussion were using statistics to present a library budget to elected officials and the use of library meeting rooms by controversial speakers. I participated in the shadowing program for our staff development project on April 4 and attended a Chamber of Commerce Business After Hours at the Maine Center for Mental Health. I will attend, with John Burke, a workshop on the new PLA Planning Process on April 11 and a Customer Service workshop at Oakton Community College on April 16.            </p>            <p>              I have been working with Douglas and Maxine Hubbard and staff members Carol Kidd, Gary Valente, Veronica Schwartz, Gail Bradley, Leslie Steiner, and Chris Posinger to plan the Dedication Ceremony and reception for the Poet Tree Corner. Martha Sloan is working with the Hubbards and ASI signage to prepare the signage recognizing their gift.            </p>            <p>              The fire extinguishers have been installed in all floors of the parking garage near the elevators. They are housed in locked cabinets, which are alarmed. Thanks to the Public Works and Fire Departments for their quick response to our requests.            </p>            <p>              We are continuing to work with CCS and NSLS to recapture statistics of library use during the transition to new computer systems. We believe we will be able to access this information, but perhaps not for another three to four months.            </p>            <p>              Two staff committees are working on pending issues: Martha Sloan is chairing a staff committee to gather information and to make recommendations regarding additional hours for public service. Hector Marino is chairing a committee to plan procedures for collecting, processing, and circulating materials in foreign languages.            </p>            <p>              Our Volunteer Recognition Tea has been rescheduled for Wednesday, May 15 from 3:00 to 4:30.

Leslie stated that 138 people used the SelfCheck and initialed the log.            </p>            <p>              John Ciborowski thanked Mayor Arredia and the City Council for the proclamation from the City of Des Plaines for National Library Week.            </p>            <h2>              CORRESPONDENCE            </h2>            <p>              Sandra Norlin reported that the library has been named as a beneficiary to a charitable remainder trust.            </p>            <p>              MOTION by Rhys Read, seconded by Ellen Yearwood, to enter into an Executive Session at 8:10 PM to discuss Sale or Lease of Real Property and Administrator&#39;s Review.
