Thus far in 2008, use of the self-check averages 45%, which is a strong rate of use from which to build for our emphasis on self-service with our atrium remodeling. Please note the increase in business cards from last year at this time. This increase is the result of concentrated effort of Joanne Griffin, our business liaison librarian. Joanne planned a very successful Chamber of Commerce After Hours event on December 9, at which 5 new businesses registered for their library cards. We continue our efforts to serve residents outside of the library building. This month the number who attended our programs and events was 811. There were over a 100,000 uses of our website in November, by nearly 28,000 individuals. Nearly half of the uses were from computers outside of the library.                        </p>                        <h3>                            OTHER PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES                        </h3>                        <p>                            On 11/20 I hosted a meeting of the Library Production Studio Executive Committee; on 11/24 I and several staff members traveled to Barrington library to see their 3M/FKILogistex RFID system at work. Also that day I rang the bell for the Salvation Army red kettle program for two hours at Jewel Osco at Lee and Oakton. It was cold, but productive and inspiring. I attended the Friends of the Library meeting on 11/25. I briefly attended the Learn to Read end of session buffet and program on 12/1; the CCS Governing Board meeting on 12/3, and the Holiday Lighting Ceremony on 12/5.
