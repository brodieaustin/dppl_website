The Adult and Teen SRC had 133 adults and 75 teens participating. The children's program had 2009 enrolled and 1054 who completed all requirements. Look for the Carnival of Reading t-shirts the finishers are wearing. The pre-readers listened to 13,376 and our independent readers read for 10,176 hours in June and July. The attendance at the programs was also high.<br />                            <br />                            The highlight of the summer was the Harry Potter extravaganza held on July 20/21 from 9:30 to just after midnight. It's hard to tell from the reports and fan letters who appreciated the evening most, the 96 kids, their parents, or the staff and volunteers who worked on the planning and the night at Hogwarts. For a taste of this splendid event, please look at the video on our website.<br />                            <br />                            The month in numbers shows a decline in use and attendance, except for attendance at programs and meetings. Just over half of all items circulated in July were print, with DVDs as the only medium gaining in use.

Sandra stated that the companies bid low and after a short period of time try to clean the 82,000 sq ft building with only 2 &ndash; 3 people for a few hours each evening. The results are that valuable library staff time is spent calling the cleaning companies reporting problems that should have been addressed by the cleaning company. The library has changed cleaning services several times and the results are the same.
