       The Circulation staff has made a concentrated effort to assist and train patrons in use of the self-check machines. Their goal was to increase use of the self-check from 20% of circulation from the main library to 30% by July 1. The results of their efforts within one month are impressive. In January 37% of materials checked out of the main library were checked out on the self-check machines.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I believe that the unusually cold weather during January caused the decrease in use of the library in nearly all areas, from attendance to use of computers in the youth services department. Reference and Readers Services did experience an increase in requests for service as did adult computer use.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I decided to close the library at 5 PM on Tuesday, February 13 because of hazardous weather conditions.
