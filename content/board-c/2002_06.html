       The regular meeting of the Des Plaines Public Library Board of Trustees was held in the second floor conference room on Tuesday, June 18, 2002. President John Ciborowski called the meeting to order at 7:00 PM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Members Present: Inara Brubaker, Eldon Burk, John Burke, Susan Burrows, John Ciborowski, William Grice, Noreen Lake, Rhys Read, Ellen Yearwood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Present: Administrator Sandra Norlin, Carol Kidd, Martha Sloan, Hector Marino, Mayor Anthony Arredia, George Bo'ldirev, Vince Powers, Wayne Serbin.
      </p>
      <h2>
       MAYOR ANTHONY ARREDIA - WORKING RELATIONSHIPS
      </h2>
      <p>
       Mayor Arredia spoke to the Board about preparations for a memorial observance on September 11, 2002. The mayor stated that the ceremony would commemorate the victims and families of 911 and community groups, ministries and guest speakers would participate. Mayor Arredia stated that the City of Des Plaines will make a statement about patriotism with the ceremony, which will be held on library plaza and asked Library Administrator, Sandra Norlin, to be involved with the planning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mayor Arredia advised the Board that he has received several requests from Des Plaines residents to be appointed to the library board. The mayor asked President Ciborowski if he and two or three board members would meet with him to interview prospective board members. Mayor Arredia explained that he would be reviewing not only the library board commissions, but other commissions within the City of Des Plaines. Mayor Arredia asked current board members to consider whether they would like to continue serving on the board and welcomed their suggestions for future appointments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eldon Burk thanked the mayor for the opportunity to be involved with future appointments to the Board.
      </p>
      <p>
       President Ciborowski stated that it was good that there were so many qualified people wanting to be on the board.
      </p>
      <h2>
       PUBLIC COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS
      </h2>
      <p>
       Vince Powers stated that the cyclone fence that was installed between library plaza and the train tracks is unsightly and suggested that the Friends of the Library and the Keep Des Plaines Beautiful Commission join forces to solicit donations so that a wrought iron fence could be installed. President Ciborowski thanked Mr. Powers for his suggestion.
      </p>
      <p>
       George Bo'ldirev stated that he was representing 10 patrons who frequent the library between 9:00 AM and 12:00 noon daily. He stated that these patrons are concerned with the noise level, which prevents them from doing research on the computers. Mr. Bo'ldirev stated that conversations in the library are too loud and asked whether the library had a policy regarding noise levels. President Ciborowski replied that conversations cannot disturb other patrons. William Grice asked Mr. Bo'ldirev if a complaint was made to library staff and Mr. Bo'ldirev responded no. President Ciborowski suggested that Mr. Bo'ldirev submit his complaint in writing and the Management Committee would address these issues at their next meeting. Mr. Bo'ldirev was given the form "Citizen's Opinion Concerning Specific Library Policies, Rules, or Procedures."
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Bo'ldirev stated that cell phone usage at the library was disturbing patrons and library staff did not approach patrons using the phones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Bo'ldirev stated that he was concerned that young children were being allowed to use computers on the fourth floor and were accessing pornographic sites. Mr. Bo'ldirev voiced concern that children were not prevented from using the computers by either their parents or the library staff. President Ciborowski responded that patrons should report these activities to the librarian at the desk.
      </p>
      <p>
       President Ciborowski stated that all computers in the Youth Services Department on the second floor are filtered and that the library's filtering policy is reviewed on a regular basis. Susan Burrows stated that the librarians monitor patrons when they are made aware of a situation that is making another patron uncomfortable. Ellen Yearwood stated that the library's policy on noise level is written as incident specific and that the library staff will intervene when patrons notify them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Board will refer these issues to the Management Committee and William Grice suggested that the meeting notice state that Public Comments Are Welcome. William Grice also asked that when a written report is received from Mr. Bo'ldirev it should be directed to the Management Committee for discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandra Norlin stated that library staff treats all patrons with complaints with the utmost respect.
      </p>
      <h2>
       CONSENT AGENDA
      </h2>
      <p>
       William Grice asked that VI-A Approval of the Minutes of the Regular Board Meeting - May 21, 2002 be removed from the Consent Agenda. Noreen Lake asked that VI-C.2 Warrant Register - May 20, 2002 - $53,286.08 be removed from the Consent Agenda. Rhys Read asked that VI-D.3 Management Committee Report be removed from the Consent Agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       William Grice asked that the minutes of the May 21, 2002 be changed to state that he was absent from the Board meeting on May 21, 2002 because he was at the same event as Alderman Argus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Noreen Lake asked about the library expense of $500.00 to the Illinois State Police and Sandra Norlin responded this is for the background checks the library does on new employees and volunteers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rhys Read asked for a discussion on the recommendation by the Management Committee to curtail videotaping Board meetings to twice a year. Rhys Read asked that videotaping the meetings four times a year be continued until feedback from residents can be compiled. William Grice stated that he has not had any feedback from residents on the videotaping and would rather have active involvement at the Board meetings from residents. William Grice also stated that this is a budget issue and Susan Burrows stated that this was a cost effective measure. Rhys Read asked that the tapings be continued for another year. Eldon Burk suggested that a survey be done after two years of taping and that the library market the taped meetings more aggressively. Hector Marino stated that Josh Pfluger has requested a tentative schedule for future tapings.
      </p>
      <p>
       MOTION by Committee, to videotape two library board meetings in the next 12 months, one in September when the budget is being discussed and the other date to be determined and to ask Library Administrator, Sandra Norlin, to ask Leslie Steiner, Head of Public Information, to encourage public attendance at the Board meetings by promoting the Board meetings with additional publicity and to determine at a later date allocation of the $600 savings. Vote: Ayes: Grice, Yearwood, Lake. Nays: Brubaker, Burk, Burke, Burrows, Read. MOTION FAILED.

       Several staff members have attended classes and workshops through the North Suburban Library System, including Supervisory Training and Computer Applications. Hector Marino attended the Mexican Library Association annual conference in Monterrey as an invited guest speaker. Holly Sorensen, Hector Marino, and Heidi Krueger are attending the ALA Annual Conference in Atlanta, June 13-18.
      </p>
      <p>
       The final report of the Residents and Retailers Grant contains many suggestions for improving our programming by increasing the number of programs we already provide. Another request was for increasing the number of newsletters to at least six per year. The comments about the library's service were overwhelmingly positive. The respondents praised the library staff for their skills, helpfulness and hospitality. Several of the merchants in the neighborhood offered to give programs and to support activities. In short, the respondents liked our services and want more.
      </p>
      <p>
       The increase in circulation continues. We have checked out 11.13% more items this year than by this time in 2001, with this month's circulation 16.57% higher than last May's. Use of Self-check represents 20% of our total circulation. We have increased our cardholders over last year by nearly 3,000 (69% of population), and we are sustaining a 12% increased in attendance, year to date. Please note the high increases in Reference and Readers' Advisory Services and in computer use in both Adult and Youth Departments. Our holdings have increased by 5,366 items since February.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since my last report I have represented the library at the following events: the Chamber/City Advisory Breakfast, the CCS Governing Board, the Library Cable Network Executive Committee, the Taste of Des Plaines, and the Northwest Suburban Unity Dinner. I attended a class on Microsoft Word 2000. I met with coordinators of District 207 summer employment program, concerning placement of their students at the library this summer.

       Martha Sloan, Coordinator of Public Information, presented a final report on the "Residents and Retailer: Fulfilling Our Dreams" grant. Martha reported that a survey was distributed to downtown condominium residents as part of the grant project and residents responded positively to the new library. Martha also reported that downtown businesses were surveyed and results were again positive. Results of the survey were distributed to Board members.

       Hector Marino, Coordinator of Computer and Technical Services gave an update on the foreign language collection that is now being cataloged. Hector is chairing a committee that will work with schools, create questionnaires and compile demographic data to discern the needs of the community. Hector also stated that focus groups will be formed to discuss the needs of patrons using the foreign language collection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Susan Burrows asked how the staff would determine if a book met the library's criteria if the staff member was not fluent in the language. Hector Marino responded that some vendors send reviews in English and that librarians are able to translate some of the materials. Hector also stated that library patrons fluent in foreign languages are asked to review some of the material
      </p>
      <p>
       Martha Sloan reported that library staff had discussed adding one hour to the Sunday schedule. The cost for staffing for one additional hour would be $38,962 for the year. The addition of part-time librarians could be needed to accommodate the extra hour on Sunday. The staff concurred that eliminating an hour in the current library schedule would be disruptive to our patrons. The matter will be referred to the Management Committee and Finance Committee for further discussion.
