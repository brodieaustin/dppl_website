Heather also reported that online ticket sales totaled more than $2,100.00.            </p>            <p>              Library Director Sandra Norlin reported that the Des Plaines Public Library requested proposals for an automated sorting and RFID system from four vendors. Three responses were received, but one of the responses was a letter declining to submit a proposal.Ãƒâ€š&nbsp; The responses for the RFID system were from SirsiDynix in the amount of $840,094 and Bibliotheca in the amount of $493,610. Sandra also reported that the total appropriation for this system in the 2008 budget is $702,392.            </p>            <p>              Sandra NorlinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s recommendation to the Board was a modified proposal from SirsiDynix in the amount of $707,772, because of the reliability of the 3M products and service. Sandra recommended the SirsiDynix proposal for the following reasons:            </p>            <ol>              <li>The tested reliability of the 3M products and service. The Des Plaines Public Library has relied upon 3M security materials and detection systems for 20 years and has confidence in their products, service, and personnel.              </li>              <li>The libraryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s integrated automation system is provided by SirsiDynix. The RFID security, checkout, checkin, and automated sorting systems must be compatible with this system. SirsiDynix does not recommend the Bibliotheca system because it has not yet been tested for compatibility.              </li>              <li>Bibliotheca headquarters is in Switzerland. No one from this company has visited the site for personal knowledge of our library. This company may be trying to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbuy the marketÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬ through aggressive pricing that underbids the companies currently serving the library market to obtain a foothold with libraries. I am concerned that with this low bid will come change orders that will increase the cost of the project, delays that will cause us to miss our deadline of December, 2008, and a lack of responsive, onsite service.              </li>            </ol>            <p>              Matthew Bogusz asked why the total amount for the RFID system was not budgeted for in the 2008 budget and Sandra Norlin responded that an additional workstation was added to the Request for Proposal and that there was an increase in the number of tags required, in addition to some other changes. Matthew Bogusz asked if there was an increase in the cost of the equipment and Matt Bellamy, 3M Library Systems representative, answered that the pricing did not change. Matthew Bogusz stated that he did not think that enough research had been done to prove that the Bibliotheca equipment and the service they would provide would not work with the current library equipment.            </p>            <p>              <b>MOTION</b> by Eldon Burk to accept the proposal from SirsiDynix to provide an RFID Materials Handling and Security System as modified through mutual agreement in the amount of $707,772, subject to legal review of the terms and conditions of the agreement, which is in the best interest of the Des Plaines Public Library.            </p>            <p>              <b>MOTION</b> by George Magerl, seconded by Jerry Mahony, to amend the motion by striking out the words ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œin the amount of $707,772ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬ and inserting the words ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfor a cost not to exceed $707,800.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬ Ãƒâ€š&nbsp;<b>ROLL CALL VOTE:</b> AYES: Burk, Lake, Magerl, Mahony.
