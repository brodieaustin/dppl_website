       ADMINISTRATOR'S REPORT
      </h2>
      <p>
       New employees hired since February are Gwen LaCosse, Part-time Library Assistant II, Lisa Beauvais, Part-time Librarian I, Mary Ellen Lunde, Karen Stricker, Osman Ahmed, and Christopher Jost, Pages (part-time).
      </p>
      <p>
       Veronica Schwartz has been promoted from Librarian I to the position of Head of Youth Services. She began her new duties March 5, 2001.
      </p>
      <p>
       A quarterly all-staff meeting was held Thursday, March 15. The agenda included a version of the Orientation Program and the introduction of another opportunity to participate in the Learning Organization training. This opportunity involves work analysis and design.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eight staff members have registered for the annual conference for library assistants, Reaching Forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three staff members attended a one-day seminar presented by the Disney Corporation. The seminar encouraged creativity and customer service, highlighting the Disney methods.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you can see from the charts and numerical reports, library business is thriving. Our registrations continue to grow, our attendance is up 39% over this month a year ago, and our circulation has increased by 8% year to date. The use of our meeting rooms is booming and reports from attendees at our programs have been positive and appreciative. It has been a very good month.
      </p>
      <p>
       Public service is challenging because of the new spaces and distances in the library, but staff is working together on solutions. The Learning Organization/Work Design project may bring more changes, but they will be changes brought forward by staff members themselves, who will be trained in the specific skills of analyzing the work that needs to be done and designing processes to complete the work most efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within the past month Sandra has met with the City Holiday Event Committee to help plan next December's activities, the Executive Service Corps to plan the April 21 Board Planning Retreat, and the Library Cable Network Executive Committee.
