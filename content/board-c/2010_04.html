The theme is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgreenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬ and will be supported by speakers and hands on breakout sessions. All events take place in the library throughout the day.            </p>            <h3>              PATRON SERVICES            </h3>            <p>              You will notice that our March 2010 circulation numbers decreased. However, that is in comparison to March 2009, during which circulation increased by nearly 15% over March 2008. Patron use of the library continues to exceed even those high figures from 2009, with an overall, year to date increase of 5.5%.            </p>            <p>              Please note the strong (23%) increase in public attendance at the library during March as well as the high number of virtual visitors to our website (25,665).            </p>            <p>              This week I received a printed copy of the report of a nationwide study of patron use of the internet at American public libraries. The study was funded by a grant from the Institute for Museum and Library Services and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It was conducted by the University of Washington Information School. The Des Plaines Public Library participated in the study. The findings put to rest the often heard comment that the internet will make libraries obsolete.            </p>            <p>              According to this study, 1) internet access is now one of the most sought after public library services, and is used by nearly half of all visitors, 2) young adults(14 to 18 yrs) are attracted to use libraries to access the internet and report that their most common use is to do their homework, 3) people use the librariesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ computers for both routine tasks, such as getting news and keeping in touch with friends and family, as well as for serious life events, such as job and college applications, and learning about medical conditions and treatments. There are other findings to be explored in this 212 page report, but the overall discovery is that public libraries remain important to our residents because of, not in spite of, internet access.            </p>            <h3>              OTHER PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES            </h3>            <p>              I attended the Public Library AdministratorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Forum at NSLS on March 19, the Friends of the Library Roundtable meeting on March 23, the Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors breakfast with Mayor Moylan on March 24, and the CCS Governing Board meeting on March 31.
