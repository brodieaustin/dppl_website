All full-time Circulation Department staff, Martha Sloan and I attended. Linda Leahy and Mary Dewyer of Peopleworks facilitated the meeting. The goal of this meeting was to give Susan Farid, Martha, and I the opportunity to describe our vision for customer service at the library. The session ended with all of us taking the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator inventory. There will be two more follow-up meetings with the full staff, with consultations for Susan Farid between the sessions.                        </p>                        <p>                            The Department Heads took a field trip to the Mexican Fine Arts Museum in Chicago on October 3. We received a back room tour of their expanded facilities and viewed their excellent exhibits, including their annual Day of the Dead exhibit. We will be exploring partnership arrangements with the museum.                        </p>                        <p>                            Our increases in services in all areas of the library continue. I'd like to commend the following staff members for outstanding service during this past month. Martha Sloan and Margie Borris wrote three applications for Illinois State Library grants and were awarded all three. One grant is for staff development, one for developing attractive displays for books on the first floor, and one is a development grant to discover how the library can best serve its new neighbors, both condo residents and business owners. With the pending Project Next Generation Grant, the total monetary award is about $32,000.                        </p>                        <p>                            Veronica Schwartz and her Youth Services staff also deserve special recognition for their work in organizing and presenting the annual School Librarian's Tea. Veronica headed up the annual Breast Cancer Awareness drive, earning $220 from staff contributions. You may have noticed donors wearing denim on October 5.                        </p>                        <p>                            Margie Borris and Christine Posinger deserve our thanks for their successful efforts to plan an appropriate first anniversary celebration. Chris made arrangements for the entertainment and refreshments and Margie planned the Peace Pole Dedication, which was touching in its simplicity and pertinence. Martha Sloan oversaw the plans and preparations for this event.                        </p>                        <p>                            Margie Borris is the producer of the power point presentation on the history of the Des Plaines Public Library. It will be broadcast on Channel 17.                        </p>                        <p>                            Our new department, Readers' Services, submitted a Year in Review report, which points how many readers aides they have prepared (132), how many book discussions they conducted (14), how many displays were created, newsletter columns written, and special projects managed.

Eldon Burk asked if an estimate had been requested from Juno Lighting and Sandra Norlin responded an estimate had been received, but that Juno Lighting does not offer the type of lighting the artist is recommending.                        </p>                        <p>                            Sandra Norlin distributed copies of Pae White's revised drawing for the third floor artwork. Sandra explained that the colors in the completed artwork will be more intense and that the whimsical faces are Pae's trademark. Susan Burrows stated that the artwork will not incorporate the entire south wall. Eldon Burk stated that he and the Art Committee were not aware that the artwork would not be continuous across the wall.                        </p>                        <p>                            President Ciborowski thanked the Friends of the Library for their generous contribution of $8,500.00 for the installation of the third floor artwork.

Rhys Read asked if there was an alternative to the microfilming and Sandra Norlin replied that the library has all forms of medium, but that microfilm gives complete and full images. Sandra also stated that microfilm is still a credible source of storing data.                        </p>                        <p>                            MOTION by Susan Burrows, seconded by John Burke, to approve payment in the amount of $8,351.00 to the Gale Group for subscriptions for Student Resource Center Silver and Biographical Resource Center.
