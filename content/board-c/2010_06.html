Mr. Sayad suggested that the library board recruit a new director so that the best qualified person is chosen for the position. Mr. Sayad stated that in 2004 he recommended that the library become a district and the library board responded that it was too costly and was not in the taxpayers best interest. He asked why the board has this item on the agenda, since he does not think the residents of Des Plaines are in favor of the library becoming a district.            </p>            <p>              Dion Kendrick, 943 Webster, stated that he is opposed to the immediate appointment of a new Executive Director and requests that the board wait to make that decision until after new board members are sworn into office. He stated that the Board should go through a recruiting process to fill the library director position.            </p>            <p>              Steven Mokry, 656 Pearson St, stated that he is in agreement with Mr. Kendrick and that any decision concerning the library director appointment be postponed for 30 days when new board members will be sworn into office.            </p>            <h2>              CITY COUNCIL COMMUNITY SERVICES COMMITTEE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Alderman Dan W. Wilson.            </h2>            <p>              Alderman Wilson stated that he had received a number of emails from residents concerned that the library was not participating in the van delivery service through North Suburban Library System and that for a few pennies the library could participate. He responded to the residents by stating that the van service would be costly and is a non-budgeted expense. He reassured residents that 90% of the materials requested are in the libraryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s collection.            </p>            <h2>              CONSENT AGENDA            </h2>            <p>              <b>MOTION</b> by Eldon Burk, seconded by George Magerl, to approve the Consent Agenda, as modified. <b>VOTE</b>: AYES: All.

Joanne is the libraryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s business liaison librarian. Joanne meets with local business owners and encourages them to apply for a library card.

Currently, Joanne is working with Web Services Librarian Karen McBride, preparing video presentations for local business to promote their business on YouTube.            </p>            <h2>              DIRECTORÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S REPORT            </h2>            <p>              Please note: I have received no official requests for confidential patron information since my last report.            </p>            <h3>              PERSONNEL            </h3>            <p>              One new employee for May/June 2010: Ju Kyoung Seo, Page, Circulation Services. Holly Sorensen and I have completed the interview process for the Head of Youth Services. We are now checking references and will make a decision and an offer by June 15.            </p>            <h3>              STAFF DEVELOPMENT            </h3>            <p>              Karen McBride is conducting workshops in Springfield at the Illinois State Library the week of June 14-18 as part of the ISLÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s grant project ILEADU, in which Illinois librarians with expertise in technology applications teach other library employees. KarenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s areas of expertise are the use of video, website design, and social networking applications.            </p>            <p>              Our annual Staff Inservice Day was held on May 14. It was planned by a staff committee under the leadership of Holly Sorensen. The theme of the day was the practical side of becoming ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgreen.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬ The featured speaker of the day was from The Green Mama, a Chicago-based educational service that explores and teaches the everyday issues of sustainability and ecological living practices. Staff members also taught mini-sessions on making safe household cleaning products, skin care products, pet foods, and discovering oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s carbon footprint.            </p>            <h3>              PATRON SERVICES            </h3>            <p>              The number of items checked out during May was 3% less than in May of 2009. There was a 23% drop in items checked out from the Mobile Library. Libraries throughout this region are reporting both increases and circulation patterns/trends similar to ours. The use of our services other than check outs is also an interesting mix. We have a reduction of over 3,000 in card ownership, attributable to the one-time purge of expired cards that had less than $5 in outstanding fines. We have an increase of 19% in patron attendance at the library, year to date, over the same period in 2009. Visits to PlainTalk, the Blog posted by Karen McBride have increased by 61%, perhaps because of the announcement of the changes in van delivery service. Use of our public computers and use of our online reference products have all declined since last year at this time.            </p>            <p>              All in all, the public reaction to the new limits on placing holds has been accepting. We have had a number of questions and comments, but there have been no drastic reductions in service to date. The number of items that come through the van delivery service has dropped significantly, but the demand for Interlibrary Loan is increasing. We will report the developments as they occur.            </p>            <h3>              OTHER PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES            </h3>            <p>              I attended the Annual Meeting of the Friends of the Library on May 25.
