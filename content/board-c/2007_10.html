       Elaine Tejcek asked Sandra Norlin if the total number of registered borrowers for Des Plaines was normal when compared to other communities and if so, to what do we owe the low number of registered borrowers. Sandra Norlin responded that one of the ways the library tries to encourage new users is by asking businesses to offer a discount to library users who use their library cards. This promotion benefits both the businesses and the library. Sandra also stated that the library is in the process of trying to encourage Des Plaines business owners to get a library card.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Elaine Tejcek also asked Sandra Norlin if she was concerned with the decrease in the use of interlibrary loan and Sandra responded that two new libraries joined the North Suburban Library System, Evanston and Glenview, so there are more books available for transfer between libraries.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Matthew Bogusz asked Sandra Norlin if statistics for online database use could be separated to differentiate between resident and non-resident library cardholders. Sandra was not sure if this request was possible because of the way the information is gathered. She will inquire and report her finding to the Board.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Matthew Bogusz also asked Sandra Norlin if she thought the increase in the use of the Virtual Reference Desk indicated that patrons are moving away from using library computers and are using their home computers to do their research. Holly Richards Sorensen, Coordinator of Public Services, responded that more patrons are finding the link to our website where they have the opportunity to &ldquo;chat&rdquo; online with a librarian who will help to answer their question or to direct them where to look for the answer. Holly also stated that when school starts, students use this service and the number of users increases.
