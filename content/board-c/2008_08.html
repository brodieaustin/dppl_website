      <h3>
       STAFF DEVELOPMENT
      </h3>
      <p>
       All staff members are actively engaged in the tagging procedures for our RFID conversion. Each part-time person is required to tag at least one hour per week, with the option of adding hours up to three each week. Each full time person is required to tag at least three hours per week. We now have two portable tagging units on site and are expecting the third to arrive within a week. A tagging station has been set up in the circulation workroom to tag items as they are checked in to the library. As of this writing, we have tagged 40,000 items. I am pleased with the high level of enthusiasm and participation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I awarded three Employee Bonus Awards for the second quarter. The recipients are Bob Blanchard, Cheryl Gladfelter, and Frank Schade. I make the selections from nominations submitted by staff members.
      </p>
      <h3>
       PATRON SERVICES
      </h3>
      <p>
       We are maintaining our small increase in circulation year to date as well as a decrease in in-person attendance. Use of our online reference resources has increased by 33% over last year at this time. And, thanks to the diligent efforts of Karen McBride and Frank Schade, we can report the external and internal use of our website and its resources. This month 46% of the hits on our website were from external IP addresses.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have met with the principal of Orchard Place School, Lauren Leitao, to discuss the perennial issue of Orchard Place students who reside in Rosemont and who do not have library cards. Teachers are reluctant to bring their classes to the Mobile Library during its bi-monthly stops there because so many cannot check out library materials. We brainstormed and have come up with some reasonable, doable approaches.
      </p>
      <p>
       Holly Sorensen, Carol Kidd, and I have been meeting with department heads to discuss their budget requests for 2009. We are waiting for information from the City Finance Department on personnel salary and benefits for 2009 as well as any increases that are offered as guidelines for the city departments&acirc;&euro;&trade; budget preparation. I perused the city&acirc;&euro;&trade;s audit report for 2007 on the city website, which has just recently become available. The library&acirc;&euro;&trade;s end of 2007 fund balance was $1.3 million, slightly under our projections, which will require adjustments to the 2009 budget projections.
      </p>
      <p>
       The library received a $15,000 grant award through the Build Illinois funds, thanks to the efforts of Representative Rosemary Mulligan. We will use the funds to purchase an RFID selfcheck unit for the Youth Services floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will be a site for voter registration in September &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; October. All staff, trustees, and Friends of the Library are invited to become deputy registrars. Training meetings are scheduled for Tuesday, August 19 at 1:30 PM and Monday, August 25 at 5 PM. Attendance at only one is required to become a deputy registrar.
      </p>
      <h3>
       OTHER PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES
      </h3>
      <p>
       I attended the Library Production Studio executive committee meeting on 7/15 and interviewed candidates for the open position of Studio Director on 7/22. As a member of Rotary I assisted with the filling of back to school backpacks for the Salvation Army on 7/22, followed by a luncheon meeting of the Executive Board of the Chamber of Commerce. I attended the CCS Governing Board meeting on 7/23. On 8/5 I helped the Chamber of Commerce Board and staff serve 1200 ears of buttered sweet corn at the Des Plaines National Night Out event at Lake Park.
      </p>
      <p>
       On 8/25 DP Rotary Club will present a check to the library for our half of the proceeds from the 2008 Do the Dewey fundraiser.

      <p>
       Sandra Norlin stated that Heather Imhoff, Head of Public Information, designs and writes a daily report which is emailed to all staff each morning. The &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Morning Report&acirc;&euro; is filled with helpful library information for staff, including program information for the day.

       The Des Plaines Public Library website now includes the board members&acirc;&euro;&trade; email addresses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandra Norlin stated that she met with John Hecker, Executive Director for the Des Plaines Park District, to discuss the feasibility of a joint library/park district card. Mr. Hecker explained that the park district issues about 3,000 cards a year, so the joint card was not practical. The library may work with the park district on other programs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandra Norlin met with the principal of Orchard Place School, Lauren Leitao, to discuss the ongoing problem of students who live in Rosemont and do not have Des Plaines library cards. Sandra explained that the Mobile Library makes a stop at Orchard Place School, but teachers are reluctant to take students to the mobile library when they do not have a Des Plaines library card and cannot check out materials. Sandra stated that the library and Orchard Place School will work together on projects to encourage Rosemont residents to purchase and use a Des Plaines Public Library cards. Rosemont residents pay only one-fourth of the cost of the card and the Village of Rosemont pays the remaining three-fourths.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandra reminded the board that the September board meeting will be Tuesday, September 23.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandra Norlin and Eldon Burk were invited to Sysco Foods for a donation giveaway of discontinued items. The library received many items to be used for library programs and for the fundraiser Do the Dewey.

       Sandra Norlin stated that the library will receive a check for one-half the proceeds from the Do the Dewey fundraiser, which is approximately $7,000.00.
      </p>
      <p>
       The library croquet tournament will be held on Saturday, October 11.

      </p>
      <p>
       Noreen stated that the exhibit &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Portrait of a Soldier&acirc;&euro; was well received by the public and that she received a thank you letter from the lieutenant&acirc;&euro;&trade;s governor&acirc;&euro;&trade;s office.
      </p>
      <p>
