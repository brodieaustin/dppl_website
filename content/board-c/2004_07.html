      <p>
       Compared to June 2003, we experienced an increase in circulation, a small increase in cardholders, and a small decline in attendance. The trend of increased circulation of audiovisual materials as a portion of the total circulation continues. In June AV circulation accounted for 52% of the adult materials circulation and 34% of the children's. AV circulation accounts for 46% of the total circulation. Self-check usage remains steady at 22% of all checkouts. Patron assistance in Adult Services increased by 30.5%, but decreased in both Youth Services (7.2%) and Circulation Services (17.36%). We continue to experience increased demand for Interlibrary Loan services, with requests from other libraries exceeding the requests we make to other libraries.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have received some interesting information as a result of the planning to rearrange and shift collections on the third floor. We estimate that of our Feature Videos (not DVDs), 51% of the collection is on the shelf and 93% of Nonfiction Videos are on the shelf. Eighty-nine percent of Large Print and 83% of Mysteries are on the shelf. These figures will help us decide how aggressively to weed these and other collections before we allocate shelf space.
