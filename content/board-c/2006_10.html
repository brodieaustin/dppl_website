       STAFF DEVELOPMENT

      <p>
       This month I'd like to report how our staff is contributing to professional development. Martha Sloan and Christina Tropea are presenting a program on collection development for Spanish language material through attendance at the Guadalajara Book Fair at the ILA Annual Conference on October 6; Joanne Griffin will present a poster session discussing the library's Community Conversations grant activities at the exhibits hall at the ILA Conference. I will give a presentation on visionary leadership with Mary Jane Kepner on October 4. I will also participate in the annual Scholars in Residence program at the Chicago Public Library as a panelist. The topic for the day is Appreciative Inquiry. Hector Marino was a featured speaker for a webcast program on the Sister Libraries program on October 2.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Our quarterly All-Staff meeting was held September 26. Gail Johnson of Face 2 Face Communications presented the program &ldquo;Oh, I wish I'd said&hellip;&rdquo; She and her associate Pam Parr demonstrated through humorous skits the triumphs and difficulties of providing service to the public. They left us with several good suggestions and two phrases that should come to mind when trying to solve problems presented to us: &ldquo;I'm sorry that happened.&rdquo; and &ldquo;I can help you with that.&rdquo; Feedback from the staff indicates that this was one of the most effective programs we have presented.

Use of the Self-Check dropped slightly to 20% of the total items circulated from the main library. Attendance at the library increased by 15.7% over last year's year to date totals.
