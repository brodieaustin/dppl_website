       DIRECTOR'S REPORT
      </h2>
      <p>
       I have received no official requests for confidential information since the last report.
      </p>
      <h3>
       PERSONNEL
      </h3>
      <p>
       We received one resignation since the last report. Cathy Alberts, Part-time Reference Librarian, Adult Services, resigned effective 11/30/04.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three new Security Monitors, 2 full time, 1 part time, are scheduled to begin work mid-January.
      </p>
      <h3>
       STAFF DEVELOPMENT
      </h3>
      <p>
       Gail Johnson of Face to Face Communications conducted two training sessions for supervisors to prepare us for the 2005 performance evaluations, which will determine the compensation increases of all employees based on merit alone. These sessions were held during the Department Heads meetings of 12/22 and 12/29.
      </p>
      <p>
       Training for our new and current security monitors will take place on Saturday, January 29 and will be conducted by Dick Sem and Gary Valente.
      </p>
      <h3>
       PATRON SERVICES
      </h3>
      <p>
       Circulation of all materials in 2004 increased by .49% over 2003. Total circulation again surpassed one million items for the year. Patrons used self-check machines to check out 23% of the materials. Audiovisual materials, which make up 14% of the total collection, accounted for 45% of the items checked out. Although DVD circulation is rapidly outpacing videocassette circulation, videocassette circulation still accounted for 45% of all videos items checked out in 2004. At the end of the year, our collection totaled 301,592 items.
      </p>
      <p>
       We had a slightly lower patron count in 2004, but that is without counting the New Year's Eve attendance, which we conservatively estimate at 1,500. Our meeting rooms were used 728 times by 47,174 people in 2004. The differences between 2003 and 2004 for other patron services are as follows: Adult Services patron assistance, 15.8% increase; Youth Services patron assistance, 4.4% increase; and meeting room use, 1.5% increase.
      </p>
      <h3>
       OTHER PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES
      </h3>
      <p>
       There were no outside meetings in December following the Board Meeting. In January I have attended several city meetings concerning the 2005 budget, a woman library director's networking luncheon (1/6) and the CCS Executive Committee meeting (1/12). I attended the Des Plaines New Year's Eve celebration between 8 - 10 PM.

      <h2>
       OLD BUSINESS
      </h2>
      <p>
       President Lake reported that the Des Plaines City Council voted not to charge the library for parking and administrative fees for 2005, but that the City will revisit these issues in preparation for the 2006 budget. The library will be charged for water and sewer at the resident rate, which the City of Des Plaines estimates at $5,800.00. The Board consensus was to ask the City to use the meters already installed at the library for billing purposes and not use the estimated amount of $5,800.00.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandra Norlin reported that Gary Valente, Head of Building and Security Services, requested proposals for trash and recycling removal. The lowest proposal was received by Waste Management at a cost of $3,468 a year, which includes trash pickup five days a week and recycling pickup one day a week.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Board discussed reducing the levy, because the City of Des Plaines decided not to bill the library for parking and administrative fees in 2005.

      </p>
      <p>
       President Lake asked the Board to consider reducing the levy by $20,000.00 rather than $23,000.00, so that funds are available for legal fees if it becomes necessary to review the current lease. The Board discussed reducing the levy by $20,000.00.

      <p>
       Rhys Read asked if the Face to Face Communications and Training expenditure was a 2005 budgeted item and Sandra Norlin responded that it was not. Sandra Norlin explained that $25,000 was budgeted for in 2005 for grant administration, but that the library was not awarded the grant; therefore money was available to pay Face to Face in the professional consulting category. Rhys Read stated that he did not feel that this expenditure was appropriate at this time.
