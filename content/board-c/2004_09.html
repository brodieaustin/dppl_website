      <p>
       The Fall Quarterly All-Staff Meeting was held on September 14. The topics of discussion were the new evaluation and merit-based pay system, the bonus award program, and the security audit results and recommendations. Dick Sem attended the meeting to report and to answer questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       We honored six employees who have worked at the library for 25 years or more: Lee Cho, Gail Bradley, Sue Pirie, Kelli Phillips, Margie Borris, and Diane Fellner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several staff members will attend the annual conference of the Illinois Library Association, September 28-30. Two of our staff, Margie Borris and Bob Blanchard will present information on our recent grant projects.
      </p>
      <h3>
       PATRON SERVICES
      </h3>
      <p>
       We have experienced ongoing failures of the catalog system since the SIRSI upgrade of August 17. The technical and administrative staff of CCS are working diligently to expedite progress in addressing and correcting the problems with SIRSI personnel.
      </p>
      <p>
       We experienced a small increase in circulation for August, with print materials accounting for 53% of the total circulation. For childrens' materials, print accounted for 63% and for adult materials, 48%. Patrons used self-check for 23% of the total items circulated.
       <br/>
       Attendance is close to last year's. Adult Services staff assisted adults in use of the collection and services 166,499 times. Adult computers were used 7,810 times and children's 1,782 times in August. Our meeting rooms were occupied 58 times by 40 groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the filters were installed on the adult computers on August 20, we have recorded 24 comments/complaints. Sixteen of the complaints involved being blocked from Yahoo and Hotmail. That problem was corrected on August 26. The other comments involved a variety of situations, one was a deliberate testing of the filter, one angry complaint came from a person who wanted to view adult sites and could not, another from someone who was reported by another patron and felt his privacy and access rights were violated, and the others involved popups of various questionable sexual content reported by people who did not want to see them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I received a Freedom of Information Act request for information about salaries and benefits of all current staff. Carol and I worked with the city legal, human resources, and finance departments to provide the information that we had that was not confidential.
