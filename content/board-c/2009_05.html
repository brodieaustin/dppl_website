       We celebrated National Library Workers Appreciation Day on April 14.

       The Reference staff received training on Lexis Nexis. They discovered the many layers of information in this database, with emphasis on the business module. A new subscription to Oxford Language Dictionaries Online will offer instruction, sample personal and business letters, sample resumes with audio pronunciation to learn how a word sounds.

       PATRON SERVICES
      </h3>
      <p>
       You will notice the very large increase in numbers of items circulated in the month of February as compared to one year ago. I think we, as other libraries have, can attribute this increase to the economic struggles many of our residents are experiencing, either directly or indirectly. A 14.67% increase in use, without calls for increased staffing is a tribute to both our staff and our efficient work procedures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our patrons&acirc;&euro;&trade; use of the self-check machines has increased by 63.42%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use of the website from outside the building is being tackled by Karen McBride, Web Services Librarian. She notes that the top five pages visited are: The Kids&acirc;&euro;&trade; home page, the list of databases, our job listings, and events home page, and the reference home page.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have some very active readers among our senior population, some of whom are in their nineties and reading a wide variety of books, from popular fiction to literary fiction and non-fiction.
