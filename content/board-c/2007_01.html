       Sandra Norlin reported that the company who services the library's elevators has not been responding to calls for repair from Gary Valente, Head of Building &amp; Security Services or from his staff. Sandra reported that library elevators were inspected on 12/11/06 and that some violations were found by the inspector. Daily phone calls to the elevator company resulted in some repairs being made to the elevators, but not all repairs were made to satisfy the inspector. Gary Valente recommends cancelling the current contract and entering into an agreement with Great Lakes Elevator Company. The cost for service from the current company is $300.00 per month and the cost quoted by Great Lakes is $450.00 per month. Sandra Norlin also reported that the current elevator company had not invoiced the library for services since April 2005. Sandra explained to the Board that she does not have the authority to sign another contract because the cost exceeds $5,000.00, but referenced the library's policy on library expenditures which states &ldquo;Emergency purchases of goods or services $5,000 and above that must be effected to protect the health and welfare of library personnel and patrons as well as library property may be made with the concurrence of two members of the Finance Committee.&rdquo; Rhys Read, Jerry Mahony and Elaine Tejcek concurred with the recommendation presented by Sandra Norlin to cancel the current elevator repair contract and enter into an agreement with Great Lakes Elevator Company and to ask the City Attorney to review the proposed contract with Great Lakes Elevator Company.
