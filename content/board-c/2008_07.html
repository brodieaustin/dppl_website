         Please note that our staff made 53 in person visits to community events or services in June. We are hopeful that we will soon be able to make a distinction between our internal and external connections to our website. IT staff is working on the solution. Computer use in the adult area is down slightly, year to date, and significantly in the youth services area; however, the monthly statistics show an increase in use in the youth services area over last June. Please note the significant (33%) increase in use of our online reference products.
