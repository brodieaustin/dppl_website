       The circulation count is down slightly from June, 2006, but it is good to see that the use of fiction is up in the Youth Services department. DVD circulation from the Adult Collection continues to increase. Please note the significant drop in use of our video collections. Self Check was used for 48% of our circulation from the main library in June. The numbers from use of our online reference products are being adjusted. The Gale Group was not able to provide us with accurate counts for the past three months. Computer use also remains active, with over 8,000 uses in the Adult department and nearly 1800 in Youth Services for the month of June.
