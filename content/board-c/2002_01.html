Acceptance of Financial Reports for December, 2001 be removed from the Consent Agenda and Sandra Norlin asked that E. - 4. AdministratorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Report be removed from the Consent Agenda.            </p>            <p>              Rhys Read requested that the February board packet include the financial reports for period 13 and he also requested copies of the audited financial statements for 2001. Sandra Norlin stated that the period 13 financial reports most likely will be provided by the City of Des Plaines by the end of February 2002 and the audited financial reports by March 2002.            </p>            <p>              Sandra Norlin reported that circulation totals for the year 2001 showed an increase of 22% over the year 2000. Sandra also reported that March 2001 was highest in circulation for the year and August 2001 was the second highest usage month at the library. Sandra reported that trends in library usage are changing.            </p>            <h2>              ADMINISTRATORÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S REPORT            </h2>            <p>              All staff development efforts and opportunities this month have been directed to training for the new computer system.            </p>            <p>              Five staff members have registered to attend the biannual Public Library Association Conference in Phoenix in March.            </p>            <p>              The figures that we keep in house are available for registration, patron assistance, and attendance. These numbers indicate that we have increased our services in all these areas. Attendance for the year 2001 is 454,781, which is an increase of 38.7%. The graphs of patron services show the increases in both adult and youth patron assistance over 2001. Attendance at library programs and events was 39,025 for the year 2001.            </p>            <p>              Gary Valente and his staff deserve high praise for maintaining a safe and attractive environment throughout the library. In addition to keeping the facility clean and hazard-free, his department is responsible for setting up furniture and equipment and cleaning for all meetings. With daily attendance at an all-time high in addition to the high number of meetings held throughout the year, the general appearance of the building is remarkably excellent.            </p>            <h2>              NEW BUSINESS            </h2>            <p>              Gary Valente, Head of Building and Security Services reported on the work of his department. GaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s program included a Power Point presentation with a detailed narrative of his departmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s efforts to effectively and efficiently run the building.            </p>            <p>              President Ciborowski complimented Gary ValenteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s management of the building and stated that Gary is on top of all problems and is always looking for ways to save the library money.            </p>            <p>              Alderman Sayad asked if the library had designated an employee to view the security monitors and if all the monitors were located in one location. Gary Valente responded that the security system is used as a tool by library staff to monitor activity on each floor and that videotapes can be viewed if a security issue arises.            </p>            <p>              William Grice stated that a member of his church appreciated the security provided by the library. William Grice asked Gary Valente if special uniforms were worn by security and Gary responded that the Building and Security Systems Department all wear shirts that identify them as security monitors for the library.            </p>            <p>              Alderman Sayad asked if problems with 3M security equipment for library materials had been resolved. Sandra Norlin responded that the most likely reason that alarms were being set off was that library personnel had not desensitized the magnetic strips, but that incidents of the alarm going off have decreased significantly.            </p>            <p>              Sue DÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Hondt stated that Friends of the Library were unable to view library security tapes because of the type of specialized equipment the library security system uses.            </p>            <p>              Alderman Sayad asked how long the library keeps the security tapes and Gary Valente responded that if there are no incidents to review the tapes automatically rewind and rerecord after 48 hours. Alderman Sayad suggested that additional videotapes be purchased and the library change the tapes daily. Ellen Yearwood responded that an employee of the library would have to change the tapes daily and this would be an added expense for the library. President Ciborowski referred this matter to the Building and Grounds Committee for further review.            </p>            <p>              President Ciborowski asked for Board approval to obtain two proposals for the lighting of the atrium sculpture.            </p>            <p>              MOTION by Rhys Read, seconded by Ellen Yearwood, to authorize Library Administrator, Sandra Norlin, to obtain two additional proposals for lighting the atrium sculpture. Vote: Ayes: All. Nays: None. MOTION CARRIED.&nbsp;            </p>            <p>              Alderman Argus asked if local vendors were being considered for lighting the atrium sculpture and Gary Valente responded that local vendors had been contacted.            </p>            <p>              Sandra Norlin distributed two reports prepared by Margie Borris. Margie Borris prepared a report on 2001 tours and programs and a volunteer report for 2001. Sandra reported that every department except for Building and Security Systems uses volunteers.            </p>            <p>              The Management Committee will meet on March 5, 2002 at 4:30 PM and will review the hours the library is open, including Sunday hours. William Grice asked Sandra Norlin to prepare a comparison report on hours that surrounding libraries are open. Sandra Norlin responded that she will gather the information, but also reminded the board that the library budget for 2002 is austere and an increase in library hours would mean budget cuts in other areas. John Burke suggested that this information be gathered for possible implementation in 2003.            </p>            <h2>              ANNOUNCEMENTS            </h2>            <p>              Sandra Norlin introduced Diana Wolciechowski, a resident of Des Plaines, who attends Kendall College and will work with Sandra through the end of March in an administrative internship position.            </p>            <p>              William Grice thanked the library staff and the patrons of the library for their generous contributions to the Self-Help Closet. William Grice also thanked the library for supporting the program.            </p>            <p>              Leslie Steiner reported that the library and the Des Plaines Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry are working with local businesses on a special project for National Library Week, April 14 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 20, 2002. Participating local businesses will offer a discount or special value to people who show their Des Plaines Public Library cards during National Library Week. Alderman Argus asked that this information be presented to the City Council at their January 21, 2002 meeting. Martha Sloan reported that local businesses are being invited to attend Ã¢â‚¬Å“Business Before HoursÃ¢â‚¬ at the library on February 8, 2002. This program is being sponsored by the library, Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, and the Des Plaines Economic Development Commission and funded through a grant from the Illinois State Library.&nbsp;            </p>            <p align="center">              <a href="../about_dppl/directors_board_of_trustees.shtml" class="link">back</a>            </p>          </td>        </tr>      </table>    </td>    <td width="5" height="5" background="../images/utils/feature_box_vertical.gif"></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td class="spacer_sm">      <img src="../images/utils/feature_box_corner_BL.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />    </td>    <td width="625" height="5" nowrap="nowrap" background="../images/utils/feature_box_horizontal.gif"></td>    <td class="spacer_sm">      <img src="../images/utils/feature_box_corner_BR.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td colspan="3" class="spacer_sm">      &nbsp;    </td>  </tr></table>
