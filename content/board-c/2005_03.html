       PERSONNEL
      </h3>
      <p>
       Michelle Meyer-Edley resigned her position as Fulltime Reference Librarian, Adult Services and accepted a Part-time Reference Librarian position, effective 2.25.05.

      <h3>
       STAFF DEVELOPMENT
      </h3>
      <p>
       Four staff members are attending the Bi Annual Spring Symposium of the Public Library Association in Chicago.
      </p>
      <p>
       We held our quarterly All-Staff meeting on March 8. Gail Johnson of Face to Face Communication began our year-long customer service training and staff members demonstrated our assistive technology software, online program registration and meeting room reservation system, and explained the physical changes on third and fourth floors.
      </p>
      <p>
       The annual In-Service Day planning committee has recommended that we take a bus trip to the Annual ALA Conference in Chicago this June. We can take 80-90 staff members and furnish a box lunch for the amount budgeted for the event. We will receive free ($25 value) passes to the exhibits from Demco, the library supplies and furniture company. We will need permission to close the library on Monday, June 27 rather than Thursday, May 12, 2005.

       Miriam Pollack's work with the Department Heads will begin with the Department Heads weekly meeting on March 23.

      <h3>
       PATRON SERVICES
      </h3>
      <p>
       Circulation has decreased from one year ago, as has patron attendance. Patrons used self checkout for 22% of all circulation. Forty-five percent of all materials checked out were audio visual items (53% of the adult collection and 31% of the children's). Out number of cardholders has grown slightly. Reciprocal borrowing (patrons of other libraries coming into our library to check out our materials) grew by 8.7% and Interlibrary Loan (sending our items out to other libraries and receiving items from other libraries for our patrons) grew by 17.5%. Searches of our databases increased by 73% in one year. Our patrons have used the online reference service MyWebLibrarian more than any other library in North Suburban in January (160 sessions) and February (161). I think we are seeing a growing trend of remote use of our electronic resources for reference and information purposes as well as an increase in use of our audiovisual collection. It is interesting to note that the decrease in circulation was in children's materials.
      </p>
      <h3>
       OTHER PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES
      </h3>
      <p>
       I participated in a discussion for library directors, led by Miriam Pollack, on global trends and how they affect library planning and services on 2/18. I also attended the Des Plaines Chamber of Commerce Installation Dinner/Dance on 3/18. I attended the annual NSLS Legislative Breakfast on 2/21, the Friends of the Library Roundtable Meeting on 2/22, a CCS Budget Committee meeting and a Public Library Administrators' Forum on 2/23. The main topic of discussion at the PLA was a review Reciprocal Borrowing tenets and practices. The conclusion was that the statement needs to be updated. I attended a Do the Dewey planning meeting and was interviewed by a library science student on 2/24. I attended a luncheon meeting of woman library directors of 3/3, and the CCS Executive Committee meeting on 3/9. I will meet with Helen Guevara Cox from Guadalajara on 3/11 to discuss Sister Libraries and will attend the Chamber of Commerce Legislative Luncheon.
