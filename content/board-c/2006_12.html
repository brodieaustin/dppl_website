We combined our quarterly staff meeting with the social event, which was planned and hosted by the Department Heads. The budget for this event comes from gifts of money from the Friends of the Library, the Library Trustees, and the Department Heads as well as a small amount of returns from the vending machines in the staff lounge. We very much appreciate the opportunity to hold this event at the library at no cost to the staff members so that all can attend.

Fifty-two percent of all items circulated were print materials. It's interesting to note that circulation of fiction print materials from the youth collection is higher than in the adult collection and that we are showing increases in both youth and adult foreign language fiction materials. Patrons used self-check to check out 22% of the items circulated from the main library. Susan Farid and her staff are monitoring the difficulties that patrons experience in using the self-check and staff is more actively encouraging the use of self-check by assisting first-time or reluctant patrons.<br />                            <br />                            The number of registered borrowers has increased by 577 over last year at this time, taking us to 63% of our population.<br />                            <br />                            Overall attendance is up by 12% over this period in 2005, with meeting and program attendance up by 7.5%<br />                            <br />                            Computer use in the adult floors increased by 24% and in the youth services department by 99%.

I was there to help further our plans for cooperation with our Sister Library, the Benjamin Franklin Public Library at the University of Guadalajara. Hector was my translator as well as a very busy presence at Sister Library events and committee meetings. Martha and Christina were responsible for visiting the publishers' booths and placing orders for Spanish language materials through two vendors who assist us with the ordering, customs regulations, and billing. This was my first visit to the fair and Guadalajara and I was amazed by many things: the hospitality and warmth of all participants, the vastness and high quality of the selections, and the large turnout (500,000) of people from all walks of life who attend the Fair.<br />                            <br />                            I attended the lighting ceremony at Metropolitan Square on December 1.

I attended a Public Library Administrators Forum at the College of Lake County on 12/5, a two-day seminar on Negotiation Skills 12/7 and 12/8; I took photos of children with Santa at the Lake Park Winter Festival on 12/9, attended (briefly) the Literacy Classes' end of term buffet lunch on 12/11; chaired the Board Effectiveness Committee meeting at NSLS on 12/11; attended a luncheon for Susan Burrows and presented her with the board's gift of a crystal paperweight marking her years of service as a library trustee; helped host the reception for John Burke honoring him for his receiving the Studs Terkel Award on 12/12. On 12/13 I will attend a final meeting of the New Year's Eve celebration planning committee; on 12/14 a Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors meeting; and ring the bell for the Salvation Army at Dominick's (as a Rotarian) on 12/15.                        </p>                        <h3>                            UNFINISHED BUSINESS                        </h3>                        <p>                            Sandra Norlin reported that a brokerage account was opened at the First Midwest Bank to be used for donations.
