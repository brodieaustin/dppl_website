A committee organized and coordinated by Martha Sloan and consultant Mary Jane Kepner planned the event. Nearly all expenses were covered by our Grow with a Pro Grant for staff development through the Illinois State Library. The goal of the grant was to give all employees an in depth view of the work of other departments and an increased understanding and appreciation for how each job, including their own, is integral to the successful fulfillment of the library's purpose. Job Shadowing began in March; the culmination of the program was the in-service day in May. The theme for the day, "Camp Happy River", was carried out in decorations, activities (including a campfire sing along), and refreshments. The goals of the grant were realized through group presentations of appreciation of departmental contributions. The last event of the day was the presentation of the staff totem pole, signifying each department's understanding of its contribution to the work of the whole library.                        </p>                        <p>                            We are experiencing, along with nearly all public libraries in the U.S., a continuing growth in demand and use of our services. Our attendance has increased over last year by 13.4%; our number of registered borrowers has increased by 3,000; our circulation has increased by 14%, the use of our meeting rooms is strong, and our online reference resources were used nearly 82,000 times in April.                        </p>                        <p>                            Since the last report I have represented the library at the following meetings and events: The UI Extension Advisory Council meeting and the Volunteer Banquet; The Maine Township High School Anniversary Dinner; two Taste of Des Plaines Committee meetings; The Chamber/City Advisory Council breakfast; the DePaul University Theatre School Scholarship Gala; the Public Library Administrators Forum; and the Library Cable Network Executive Committee meeting.
