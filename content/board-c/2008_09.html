        <h3>
         STAFF DEVELOPMENT
        </h3>
        <p>
         This month was difficult for our staff, particularly our Circulation Services staff. Barbara Saletnik, Assistant Head of Circulation Services, died on August 31, following an illness that was first diagnosed in July, 2007. Her last few weeks were spent at her home under hospice care, but her family let it be known that they and Barbara would welcome farewell visits from library staff. Several of us did take that opportunity. Her funeral services were held September 3 through 5. Again, staff were encouraged to attend these services to bid farewell to a beloved colleague. On Friday, September 5, immediately following the funeral mass, the funeral procession, with a police escort, drove through Library Plaza. It was a gracious way for Barbara&acirc;&euro;&trade;s family to honor the Library and our staff, many of whom stood outside in reverence, sadness, and pride.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Our RFID tagging project is proceeding apace, with over 120,000 books tagged by September 5.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         We are making plans for voter registration from now through October 7.

        <h3>
         PATRON SERVICES
        </h3>
        <p>
         We are planning a Family Night for the children and parents of Orchard Place School on Friday, October 17. We will give library tours, present brief programs, and encourage families to register for library cards.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Our Year to Date circulation has increased by 2.68%, although the circulation for August has decreased since last year. The use of our website has reached over 86,000 hits, from 19,580 unique users. 47% of the hits were from users outside of the library. Patrons conducted 10,552 searches of our online reference products.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Our library staff has made 14 visits to schools and other locations outside the library, putting them in touch with 170 this month and 5,500 to date this year.
