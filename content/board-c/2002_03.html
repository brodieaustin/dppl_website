President John Ciborowski called the meeting to order at 7:00 PM.            </p>            <h3>              CITY COUNCIL COMMUNITY SERVICES COMMITTEE - Rosemary Argus.            </h3>            <p>              Alderman Argus asked if fire extinguishers had been reinstalled in the parking garage behind the library. Sandra Norlin responded that the Public Works department would install two fire extinguishers on each floor. Sandra also reported that fire extinguishers were installed before the library opened and again when the original extinguishers had been stolen. John Ciborowski suggested an alarm be placed in the fire extinguisher boxes.            </p>            <h2>              CONSENT AGENDA            </h2>            <p>              Rhys Read asked Sandra if the library is fully staffed or if there are available positions. Sandra responded that a full-time Library Assistant II position is open in Building and Security Systems. Sandra also responded that part-time page positions are often open, since many of these positions are filled by students who schedules change and they leave their jobs.            </p>            <p>              John Ciborowski asked Sandra Norlin why some of the library statistics for February were not available and Sandra responded that since changing to SIRSI all statistics are not being captured.            </p>            <p>              Noreen Lake asked why the library required a loan of $5,000 from an anonymous lender and Susan Burrows responded that a bridge loan was needed to pay for the balance of the Poet Tree Corner. Susan explained that the donor for the Poet Tree Corner has pledged the money for the Corner, but it is to be donated in yearly installments. Noreen asked that the minutes be amended to read an anonymous lender rather than anonymous donor.            </p>            <p>              Susan Burrows requested that the proposal to turn around 52 bricks in library plaza be deferred to the Building and Grounds Committee.            </p>            <p>              Noreen Lake asked that an explanation be given for the Office Depot expenditure in the amount of $5,656.16. Sandra Norlin responded that certain office supplies are ordered in quantities to last for one year to save time and to obtain a lesser price on some items. Susan Burrows asked that a description of the payment be put in the motion.            </p>            <p>              Noreen Lake requested an explanation of the expenditure for Mergent in the amount of $2,156.00. Sandra Norlin responded that Mergent is formerly Moodys and the expenditure is for the annual online business reference service.            </p>            <p>              Susan Burrows reported that the Finance Committee discussed cataloging the backlog of 530 items for the foreign language collection that have not been cataloged due to the inability of staff to read and understand these foreign languages. The Committee recommended that the library enter into an agreement with OCLC Techpro beginning July 2002, if possible. Hector Marino stated that the contract could begin on July 1, 2002.            </p>            <p>              Noreen Lake asked that a report be prepared by library staff and presented to the Board on the circulation of the foreign language books and that if circulation is low that the cataloging not continue. Susan Burrows responded that circulation for the foreign language books now in circulation is much greater than the average mystery. Sandra Norlin stated that libraries are all struggling with the same problem and reported that language &quot;books in a box&quot; that are cataloged and ready to shelf may become available to libraries in the future from OCLC.            </p>            <p>              MOTION by Noreen Lake, seconded by Susan Burrows, to enter into an agreement with OCLC Techpro to catalog 50 foreign language books per month to begin July 1, 2002 at a cost of $40.65 per book and that payment for the cataloging is a Miscellaneous Contractual Services line item and that if the circulation of these books is low that the cataloging not continue. ROLL CALL VOTE: Ayes: Brubaker, Burk, Burke, Burrows, Ciborowski, Grice, Lake, Read, Yearwood. Nays: None. MOTION CARRIED.            </p>            <p>              MOTION by William Grice, seconded by Inara Brubaker, to withdraw the motions regarding library hours until a more thorough report can be obtained from the staff of the Des Plaines Public Library. Vote: Ayes: All. Nays: None. MOTION CARRIED.            </p>            <h2>              ADMINISTRATOR&#39;S REPORT            </h2>            <p>              New employees for February/March 2002 are Joe Mullarkey and Elizabeth Steffensen, both Part-Time Librarians I in Adult Services. We received one resignation, Bindu Soni, Part-Time Page in Circulation Services.            </p>            <p>              We held a quarterly all-staff meeting on March 7, during which we introduced the cross-training/shadowing program for staff development, which is grant-funded. We also addressed workstation ergonomic safety and the newly revised building evacuation plan.            </p>            <p>              Please note that some of the activity reports are from November 2001, the date of the last usable statistical reports from CCS. These numbers show that in the last three months we have increased our holdings by 8.3% and have increased our registrations to 38,906. Registration activity overall has decreased from this time last year by 20 %, but patron attendance has grown by 16.6%. Interlibrary Loan activities reports are puzzling because under the new iBistro system, the demand seems to have increased in our workroom, but the numbers show a decrease in materials sent to other libraries as well as overall activities. I think these numbers will be corrected in a later report. The figures listed for adult and youth patron assistance tell the story of a very busy public services staff. I am pleased to report another increase in circulation of materials in nearly all categories. Please note that self-check use is back to its pattern of use before the downtime during the transition to the new computer system. All in all, the vital signs are good.            </p>            <p>              At last month&#39;s board meeting I was asked to get information about restocking the fire extinguishers in the city parking garage. Both John Burke and Gary Valente contacted the fire department and received positive feedback. I was informed on March 12 that the signs have been installed and the extinguishers have been ordered for two units on each floor near the elevators.            </p>            <p>              We have scheduled a Volunteer Recognition Tea for April 23. Margie Borris reports some difficulty in finding recognition pins that serve our needs (most are for higher units of hours than we want to recognize. Margie has also begun an inquiry about the sister city/sister library program. She has a number of options to consider.            </p>            <p>              Since my last report I have attended the Library Cable Network Executive Committee meeting (2/20) sat for an interview with Pat Krochmal of the Des Plaines Times, met with Kevin Kirberg, Assistant Administrator of the DePaul University O&#39;Hare Campus to discuss partnership activities for our two institutions. I attended the SLURP meeting in Barrington and the North Suburban Library System Annual banquet on March 8. I attended the meeting of the Taste of Des Plaines Committee on March 11, the Chamber of Commerce&#39;s Business After Hours at the Historical Society. I attended the bi-annual conference of the Public Library Association in Phoenix from March 13 through 16.            </p>            <h2>              NEW BUSINESS            </h2>            <p>              Sandra Norlin reported that the Poet Tree Corner Dedication was being planned for Saturday, April 13, 2002 between 5:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m. Sandra asked for Board approval to suspend the meeting room rules to allow for the event. Sandra explained that the donors of the Poet Tree Corner, Douglas and Maxine Hubbard, are requesting sparkling wine be served. Rhys Read asked who would be responsible for the extra insurance coverage required to serve alcohol at the library and Sandra Norlin responded that the library is insured through the City of Des Plaines. William Grice stated that any decision regarding exceptions to the meeting room use policy should be based on its own merit. William Grice also stated that the donor has been very generous and there is no expense to the library to have this reception.            </p>            <p>              MOTION by William Grice, seconded by Rhys Read, to suspend the meeting room policy to allow after hours use of the library and to serve sparking wine with the approval of Mayor Arredia. Vote: Ayes: All. Nays: None. MOTION CARRIED.            </p>            <p>              Sandra Norlin reported that three proposals were obtained for the atrium sculpture lighting. The proposal from G &amp; I Electric Company in the amount of $5,755.60 was the lowest. Other proposals were received from Norb and Sons and Gibson Electric. William Grice asked if dimmers would be installed and Sandra Norlin responded that she would contact G &amp; I Electric to inquire whether dimmers were included in the proposal. The Board discussed funds needed for the lighting and Sandra Norlin suggested payment could be made from the Library&#39;s Capital Improvement budget, and the funds could be replaced in the budget when the promised donor funds were received. Sandra will contact G &amp; I Electric for a possible demonstration of the lighting for the sculpture.            </p>            <p>              John Burke stated that Executive Service Corps has made additional recommendations for Board improvement and asked that a Planning Committee meeting be scheduled. The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday, March 26, 2002 at 5:30 p.m.            </p>            <h2>              ANNOUNCEMENTS            </h2>William Grice, Eldon Burk, Noreen Lake, Martha Sloan and Hector Marino attended a Leadership Forum at Sears Headquarters in Hoffman Estates. Noreen Lake stated that she did not feel that the forum was geared toward a library board. Eldon Burk suggested that the library review the mission statement so that it is one simple sentence and easy to remember. Eldon Burk also suggested that the library adopt value statements. William Grice noted that the current mission statement is 17 words and not easy to remember. Eldon Burk suggested that the Board plan a retreat once a year for board renewal and revitalization. William Grice stated that he would pursue information for applying for a library grant from Sears and report his finding to the Planning Committee on Tuesday, March 26.            <p>              Noreen Lake reported that the Taste of Des Plaines would use the library plaza for the art exhibitors. Noreen suggested that careful attention be paid to how the booths are set up, so that no damage is done to the plaza or the library.            </p>            <p>              Leslie Steiner reported that the library Web site was used heavily during the first two months of 2002 with 76,436 requests in January and 88,855 requests in February.            </p>            <p>              The Building and Grounds Committee will schedule a meeting to discuss the atrium sculpture lighting, Buy A Brick and progress on the automatic side door replacement.            </p>            <p>              Sandra Norlin reported that the Des Plaines Community Senior Center will begin bus service for seniors to the library and other Des Plaines locations on April 8, 2002.            </p>            <p align="center">              <a href="../about_dppl/directors_board_of_trustees.shtml" class="link">back</a>            </p>          </td>        </tr>      </table>    </td>    <td width="5" height="5" background="../images/utils/feature_box_vertical.gif"></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td class="spacer_sm">      <img src="../images/utils/feature_box_corner_BL.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />    </td>    <td width="625" height="5" nowrap="nowrap" background="../images/utils/feature_box_horizontal.gif"></td>    <td class="spacer_sm">      <img src="../images/utils/feature_box_corner_BR.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td colspan="3" class="spacer_sm">      &nbsp;    </td>  </tr></table>
