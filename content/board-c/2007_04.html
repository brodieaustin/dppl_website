They are: Jill Franklin, Librarian II, Adult Services; Courtenay Simeone, Assistant Clerk, Circulation Services; and Becky Wenzel, Circulation Assistant, Circulation Services.

       We will be celebrating National Library Workers Day on April 17 with a brief reception with refreshments for the staff in the Library Conference Room immediately preceding the Board meeting.
       <br/>

       Gail Bradley is the coach for the library's first book cart drill team. The team, as yet nameless, will give its first public performance at Des Plaines' Fourth of July Parade.

      <h3>
       PATRON SERVICES
      </h3>
      <p style="text-align: left">
       We have experienced a decrease in all areas of service except reference and readers' advisory in the youth services department. Use of the self-check has increased again, doubling its use from a year ago and increasing to 46% of the circulation of materials from the main library.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Circulation of materials continues its pattern of growth in use of non-print materials. In March, print materials represented 50% of the total items circulated. Of the youth services collection, print circulation represents 66% of the total circulation, and in the adult services collection, print circulation represents 41% of the total circulation. There were slight increases in circulation of DVDs and in foreign language fiction from the youth services collection.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There were 13,483 uses of our online reference sources during the month of March, but that, too, was a decrease (15%) from March 2006.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       As you will see demonstrated, the Adult Services Department is addressing the potential for expanding library services to readers and researchers through our website. The Clickable Content grant will add interactivity to our web-based services.
