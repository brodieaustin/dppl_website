President Eldon Burk called the meeting to order at 7:30 PM.            </p>            <h3>              CITY COUNCIL COMMUNITY SERVICES COMMITTEE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Alderman Petersen.            </h3>            <p>              Alderman Peterson suggested that all contributions to the library be presented to the public as donations for public awareness.

Patti Gilford of Patti Gilford Fine Arts will speak to Mr. Jessup and request that more smiling faces be a part of the mural.            </p>            <p>              Susan Burrows reported that the sculpture and companion piece created for the atrium will consist of 26 letters of the alphabet plus an ampersand and the letters will be sculpted out of holographic film laminated between acrylic.            </p>            <p>              Eldon Burk visited the Thinking Lightly studio in California and reported that the sculpture materials last indefinitely, since they are encased in plexiglass.            </p>            <p>              The Board asked Kenneth Hutson and Chip Sproul of Owner Services Group, Inc. to solicit pricing for the installation of the atrium sculpture and companion piece and report back to the Board at the August meeting.            </p>            <p>              Rhys Read asked if the cost of installation of the sculpture and companion piece would be donated and Eldon Burk responded that that installation is part of the capital campaign.            </p>            <p>              MOTION by Committee to proceed with completion of the sculpture for the atrium including the companion sculpture.

MOTION CARRIED.            </p>            <p>              Betty Ritter congratulated Barbara Saletnik on the wonderful organizational skills used in preparing for the move and Eldon Burk thanked the library staff for the extra work that has been done to insure the transition between the old and new buildings.            </p>            <h3>              EXECUTIVE SERVICES CORPS            </h3>            <p>              Eldon Burk introduced Walter Roth of Executive Service Corps who proposed the development of a five-year plan for the purpose of preparing goals, identifying problems and examining Board functions. William Grice complimented Mr. Roth on his presentation and suggested an all day retreat possibly in Spring, 20001. The Board asked Mr. Roth to prepare a formal proposal and return to Sandra Norlin by October 9, 2000 for presentation at the October 17, 2000 Board meeting.            </p>            <h3>              BUILDING AND GROUNDS COMMITTEE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Betty Ritter, Chairman.            </h3>            <p>              Betty Ritter introduced Chip Sproul of Owners Services Group, Inc., who distributed the Des Plaines Public Library Project Status Report for July 2000.            </p>            <p>              Chip Sproul reported that installation of vinyl tile in the Friends room would be labor intensive due to the necessity of removing shelving already installed. Chip reported that to install flooring around the shelving would be very labor intensive due to the extra cutting involved.            </p>            <p>              Chip also reported that the book drops will be modified due to the incorrect height of the drop. Ken Hutson stated that the book drops do not blend in with the other furnishings, due to the bright metal doors. Susan Burrows responded that she did not want to consider replacement of the drops because of the additional costs to the library of approximately $5,000.00. Susan asked if the book drops could be returned and Chip Sproul responded that book drops were not returnable. The Board concurred that the book drops would not be replaced. Inara Brubaker asked that alternatives be explored. William Grice asked if the panels could be changed to provide a different finish and Ken Hutson responded that he was unsure if panels were available. Eldon Burk will contact Michael Barnes of Lohan Associates to discuss alternative solutions.            </p>            <p>              MOTION by William Grice, seconded by Susan Burrows, to approve Corporate Concepts Change Order #5 for the missing three furniture panels in Change Order #4 in the amount of $401.50, Corporate Concepts Change Order #6 for exchange of wiring harnesses/modular furniture in the amount of $182.79, Corporate Concepts Change Order #7 for 21 added keyboards in the amount of $4,877.50 and Corporate Concepts Change Order #8 for added furniture for the LAN Workroom 306 in the amount of $805.38.

Christina Brennan and Dorothea Frisbee will begin work as Part-time Library Assistant I, in the Community Services Department on July 24, 2000.            </p>            <p>              Martha Sloan and Sandra are interviewing five candidates for the Community Services Department Head position.            </p>            <p>              Two major staff development events took place this month. First, the annual staff inservice day was held on June 29, 2000. The staff concentrated on the upcoming move, paying attention to the details of physically moving to the new library as well as saying an appropriate farewell to the old building that has served us so well for over 40 years. The staff worked as a group, in teams, and as individuals at various tasks throughout the day. The midday lunch was a &quot;cookout&quot; on the grounds of the library. Seventy-one staff members attended.            </p>            <p>              The other opportunity for staff development was the Annual Conference of the American Library Association, which was held in Chicago July 7 through 11. Twenty-eight staff members attended preconferences, meeting, programs and/or exhibits. This was a good professional burst before our busy weeks of moving activities. Sandra attended a preconference on statistics gathering and reporting, and two programs, one on outsourcing technical services activities, and the other on public programming through the Writers Live! Grant program from ALA.            </p>            <p>              The last few weeks at the Graceland site were gratifying. The circulation was brisk and steady, patrons commented on the excitement of moving to a new, improved space. The &quot;report card&quot; comparison of area public libraries that Sandra distributed last month shows that the Des Plaines Public Library continues to be one of the most efficient and cost-effective libraries in this area. Coupled with the results of recent patron satisfaction surveys (focus groups most recently), this information gives us reason for pride.            </p>            <p>              In addition to ALA attendance July 7-9, Sandra attended meetings of the Fundraising Event and Grand Opening Committee meetings, and the PC and Monitor bid opening. Sandra was on vacation from June 30 through July 3.            </p>            <h2>              NEW BUSINESS            </h2>            <p>              Sandra Norlin reported that response has been good for the preview party &quot;One For The Books&quot; with 120 responses at this time.            </p>            <p>              Susan Burrows asked if a liquor license had been obtained for the preview party and Eldon Burk responded that since liquor is not being sold, he was informed by the MayorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s office a license is not necessary.            </p>            <p>              MOTION by William Grice, seconded by Susan Burrows, to suspend food and alcohol prohibition for the August 3, 2000 preview party &quot;One For The Books&quot;.
