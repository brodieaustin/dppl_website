       STAFF DEVELOPMENT
      </h3>
      <p>
       We held our quarterly All-Staff meeting on March 9 during which Consultant Mary Jane Kepner led the staff in the SWOT analysis to prepare for the strategic planning activities for the Board of Trustees.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have completed our first full schedule of Staff Technology Development classes. The classes are open to all staff and are taught by staff who are proficient in use of technology resources in use at the library. Classes in telephone use, searching the online catalog, internet, and outlook were offered.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have the opportunity to send up to ten staff members to a six-session class of Command Spanish for Library Staff at NSLS. Thus far, four staff have registered.
      </p>
      <h3>
       PATRON SERVICES
      </h3>
      <p>
       You will notice that some areas of service have decreased over the same period last year. One area of interest is the decrease of 162% in staff-assisted interlibrary loan requests. This is a welcome decrease, especially compared with the increase of 27% in interlibrary loan transactions that we handled in February. Our circulation increase of 2% is modest compared to the increases experienced over the last three years. We are paying attention to the relatively low percent (61%) of library cardholders and are planning incentive activities to coincide with national library card sign up campaigns in September. Please note that our meeting rooms were used 177 times in February.
      </p>
      <p>
       Circulation of audiovisual items was 44% of the total circulation for the month.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are launching our new readers' service, which we call Quick Picks. Multiple copies of best sellers are available for a non-renewable short-term loan for patrons who do not use the hold system. The collection is available on the third floor in the area behind the elevators.
      </p>
      <h3>
       PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES
      </h3>
      <p>
       I attended the bi-annual Public Library Association Conference in Seattle February 25 through 28. I presented a program with Anne Johnson of the Library Community Foundation on fundraising, "Not Just for the Big Guys" to an audience of 400. I also attended programs on board self-evaluation, working with elected officials, decision-making in changing environments, designing spaces for teen patrons, and compensation trends in libraries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before PLA, I attended an excellent program at NSLS: "Designing Work Environments of Tomorrow." The presenter advocated and demonstrated how to use teams effectively to manage complex processes and issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to these activities I have chaired a meeting of Library Cable Network (2/19) and a meeting on the new Illinois OCLC pricing structure and the retirement tea for Kathleen Balcolm, director of the Arlington Heights Memorial Library.
      </p>
      <h3>
       PROGRESS REPORTS
      </h3>
      <p>
       Work has begun on the Heritage Reading Room and should be completed by April 1. The new digital security camera system was installed on March 8. We now have camera surveillance in both public elevators. Frank Mraz of Lohan Caprille Goetsch has submitted drawings and specifications for workroom modification on the 1st and 3rd floors.
