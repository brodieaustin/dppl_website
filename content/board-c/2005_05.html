       I attended the CCS Executive Committee meeting on 4/20, the Library Cable Network Executive Committee meeting on 4/21, and the Public Library Administrators' Forum on 4/22. I also participated in the NSLS Reciprocal Borrowing Task Force meeting on 4/22. I attended the NSLS Board meeting on 4/25, the Friends of the Library Roundtable meeting on 4/26, meeting of the CCS Database Task Force and a preparatory meeting for attendees of the National Library Advocacy Day held at NSLS on 4/27, and the Des Plaines Volunteer Service Awards Banquet on 4/28. From 5/2 through 5/4 I participated in the Library Advocacy Day in Washington, DC. I attended the Board Finance Committee meeting on 5/9, the VITA Volunteer Recognition Dinner on 5/10, the CCS Executive Committee meeting on 5/11 and a workshop on new ways to express the value of libraries at NSLS on 5/12.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am currently involved in strategy, policy, and procedural discussions on the topic of resource sharing in three different arenas. As incoming President of the CCS Governing Board I am working at the executive committee level to formulate policies addressing how local libraries' decisions to limit access to non-residents impact other libraries in the CCS system. As chair of the CCS Database Management Committee, I am presiding over meetings to streamline the way individual libraries describe their collections so that there is more uniformity in the database, which will make it easier for patrons and staff to search the CCS-wide catalog. As a member of the Reciprocal Borrowing Task Force I am helping to rewrite the RBP tenets for NSLS, with an emphasis on encouraging resource sharing.
      </p>
      <p>
       My first experience as a library lobbyist in Washington, DC was energizing, inspiring, and productive. I think the networking that Noreen and I did among trustees and librarians, the contacts we made with congressional staff, the knowledge we gained about library issues, and the knowledge and practice of lobbying protocol we gained were the benefits of our efforts. The program was well-organized by the ILA staff and the ALA Washington office staff. Representative Jan Schakowsky was especially attentive to our concerns and supportive of our efforts.
