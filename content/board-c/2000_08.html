The library has had telephone training, customer service training, email training, and has enjoyed a number of department open houses, which have helped us to learn all the features of the new building in an informal setting.            </p>            <p>              The services the library has been able to provide have been severely limited because of the necessity of closing down the old facility and preparing the new facility for public use. During this period the old library was open for eight days and the mobile library for nine days. The library appreciates the patience of our patrons who are awaiting the opening of the new facility.            </p>            <p>              Sandra attended two exciting seminars in the past month. The first, &quot;The Library of the Future,&quot; was a presentation by an administrator of the Richmond, B.C. Public Library, who described the innovative planning and execution of a branch library that has much in common with our circumstances. As a branch in a new retail mall development, the library planners sought to appeal to the consumers in ways that would make library use easy, convenient, exciting, and familiar in a self-service culture. For example, over 85% of the circulation is done by the patrons themselves through self check when taking items out and through pre-sorting when returning the items. They are able to process 750,000 circulations with a collection of 65,000 and a staff of 13. The public loves using the facility and the staff reports very high morale and low work related repetitive motion injuries. The library is installing some of the same checkout equipment in our new facility.            </p>            <p>              The second seminar Sandra attended was &quot;Technology Survival Skills for Library Administrators,&quot; which was presented by Consultant Joan Frye Williams. She drew comparisons between the library mindset and the mindset of managers and entrepreneurs in the new technology and information management businesses. She also gave guidelines for the types of issues that were management level as opposed to technology planners&#39; level. she also pointed out that since the current business cycle is 90 days, an administrator could adequately keep abreast of trends and new developments by scanning the literature only quarterly. One statement that Williams repeated has struck a chord with me. she stated that the library profession&#39;s definition of success is perfection 100% of the time, so we spend vast amounts of staff time planning and trying to prevent errors and problems, when our time could be better spent planning new services and dealing with problems as they occur.            </p>            <p>              Sandra attended the usual round of monthly meetings, both library and community, but want to emphasize that the time spent planning &quot;One for the Books&quot; was time well spent and our efforts were rewarded tenfold.            </p>            <p align="center">              <a href="../about_dppl/directors_board_of_trustees.shtml" class="link">back</a>            </p>          </td>        </tr>      </table>    </td>    <td width="5" height="5" background="../images/utils/feature_box_vertical.gif"></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td class="spacer_sm">      <img src="../images/utils/feature_box_corner_BL.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />    </td>    <td width="625" height="5" nowrap="nowrap" background="../images/utils/feature_box_horizontal.gif"></td>    <td class="spacer_sm">      <img src="../images/utils/feature_box_corner_BR.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td colspan="3" class="spacer_sm">      &nbsp;    </td>  </tr></table>
