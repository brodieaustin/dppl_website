The other was signed into law in June but does not take effect until 2006. It pertains to the Open Meetings Act and requires that government agencies with websites display meeting agendas and related information online. The other requirement is that telephone conversations, e-mail exchanges, and other types of electronic communications are subject to the meetings law.                        </p>                        <h2>                            OLD BUSINESS.                        </h2>                        <p>                            Sandra Norlin reported that Rosemont officials have indicated that they will financially help Rosemont students attending Orchard Place School who have shown an interest in obtaining a Des Plaines Public Library card.
