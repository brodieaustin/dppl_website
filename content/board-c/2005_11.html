Half of the decrease was in the youth services collection use and the other half was in the Mobile Library collection use. 54% of the total circulation was for print materials, 69% of the Youth Services circulation and 46% of the Adult Services circulation. Patrons used the self-check machines for 21% of all items circulated from the main library. Library holdings now total 305,521. We have 35,117 registered cardholders, which represents nearly 62% of the population of Des Plaines. Our attendance count continues to be below last yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, with 900 fewer visits in October 2005 than in October 2004. Computer use increased in both adult and youth services. Use of our online database resources increased by nearly 50%. Attendance at meetings and programs in the library increased by nearly 10%. The overall use of our facilities, collections, and services is in keeping with regional and national trends of library use, including decreasing circulation of print materials and increasing use of computer and meeting room services.            </p>            <p>              The historic bricks will go on sale December 1.
