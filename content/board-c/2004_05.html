       Personnel
      </h3>
      <p>
       New employee for April 2004 is Taha A. Khan, part-time Page, Circulation Services.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Staff Development
      </h3>
      <p>
       The annual Staff Inservice Day was held on May 6. A staff committee chaired by Martha Sloan planned the event. The day was billed as a TechKnow Fair and featured an electronic gadget fair and mini-courses in practical uses of the internet all presented by staff members. It provided the opportunity for all staff to ask questions, participate in learning, and to teach in an informal, comfortable environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several staff members attended the annual Reaching Forward conference for library assistants at the Rosemont Convention Center.
      </p>
      <p>
       We held an Orientation Meeting for 15 new employees on April 28.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also on April 28 the Department Heads took a field trip to visit the headquarters of the American Theological Library Association in Chicago's South Loop.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Patron Services
      </h3>
      <p>
       For the first time since August 2000 there is no significant increase in circulation or attendance to report. We do continue to experience large increases in interlibrary loan activities as well as healthy use of online reference products. Although patron assistance by Circulation Services staff has decreased, we are experiencing large increases in computer instruction, reference, and registrations for computer lab and group study rooms. The use of school textbooks increased by 48% over April 2003.
      </p>
      <p>
       Circulation of Audio Visual materials accounted for 32% of children's materials and 51% of adult materials. Patrons used self-check to check out 23% of all items in April.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Other Professional Activities
      </h3>
      <p>
       I met with Richard Sem of Sem Security to discuss a proposal for security related services, with Andrew Van Ella of VanElla Security to discuss employee background checks, and spoke with Diane Grigg to discuss staff training for patron interaction when enforcing rules of conduct. I met with Sharon Smith, Director of Des Plaines Senior Center, to discuss a joint project to develop a satellite library in the new Senior Center facilities on Northwest Highway. I attended the Friends of the Library Roundtable meeting on April 27, the library's Volunteer tea on April 29, the De Paul University Suburban Campus Advisory Board meeting on May 11, the final Do the Dewey 2004 meeting on May 12, and the SLURP meeting on May 14.
