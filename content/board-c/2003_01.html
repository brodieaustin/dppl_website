       ADMINISTRATOR'S REPORT

      <p>
       Resignations in December, 2002: Syed Ahmed, Page, Circulation Services; Jennifer Welch, Assistant Clerk, Circulation Services; Patricia Strait, Librarian I (PT), Adult Services.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have completed my rounds of conversations with the Circulation Services Staff, except for a final meeting with Martha Sloan, Susan Farid, and Barbara Saletnik, which will be held by the end of January. The annual Staff Holiday Party was held on Thursday, December 19 at the library, during the lunch hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       A staff committee met with the consultant and the lead teacher for the grant to teach all staff some simple, basic phrases in Spanish. The goal of this grant is to make our Spanish speaking patrons feel more welcome and for staff to feel more at ease in using Spanish. The meeting was held January 6.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Job Reclassification process has begun. The first step is for all employees to complete a questionnaire about his/her position. These questionnaires will be reviewed by supervisors and forwarded to the Job Reclassification Committee. The committee's first meeting is scheduled for February 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       Library holdings at the end of 2002 are 276,247. We have recently (to be reflected in 2003 statistics) withdrawn all audiocassettes, except books on tape. The circulation of these materials has dropped drastically, and the space is needed for better display of cds, the new, more popular format.
      </p>
      <p>
       Attendance at the library grew by 18% in 2002 and circulation of materials by 13% during the same period. In December our staff handled nearly 20% more circulating materials than in December of 2001. Please note the 28% increase in Reference assistance and the 52% increase in signups for computers and study rooms.
      </p>
      <p>
       In December our homepage was accessed 110,789 times and our self-check machines were used for 20% of our circulation.
       <br/>
       I chaired the Library Cable Network Executive Committee meeting on December 19 and hosted the SLURP directors meeting on January 10.
      </p>
      <p>
       On January 10, John Ciborowski joined me at the Des Plaines Rotary Club meeting to accept a check for $10,000 for the Rotary Heritage Reading Room at the library. This is the second payment toward the $30,000 pledge from Rotary.
