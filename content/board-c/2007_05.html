      <h3>
       STAFF DEVELOPMENT
      </h3>
      <p style="text-align: left">
       On April 18 I attended, with Department Heads and Supervisors, the third meeting of the training grant &ldquo;Coaching for Commitment.&rdquo; Through this grant we are developing our skills of coaching and counseling our employees toward higher levels of performance and commitment to the goals of our organization. Mary Jane Kepner is facilitating this training.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       On May 9, Gail Johnson of Face2Face Communications will return to meet with the Department Heads as a six month followup to our November team building retreat. We will review our group agreements and our individual goals.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       On May 10, we will hold our annual Staff In-service Day. The theme is &ldquo;Be the Best You&rdquo; and will include a keynote speaker on this topic, lunch, and afternoon activities that emphasize personal health and wellness. The Friends of the Library will be presenting a cake in appreciation of the how helpful the staff is to the Friends.
      </p>
      <h3>
       PATRON SERVICES
      </h3>
      <p style="text-align: left">
       We continue to experience decreases in direct patron services, including attendance, circulation (except DVDs), and patron assistance (except some reference services). We will continue to monitor this activity to discern a trend, if there is one, and incorporate this information into our planning for future services. One of these trends is the increasing percentage of audio-visual materials that make up our total circulation. In April, 66% of Youth Services materials checked out were print and 43% of Adult materials were print. We are beginning to evaluate our materials budget for 2008 with this trend in mind.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Patrons used SelfCheck to circulate 48% of the total items checked out from the main library. Our library is participating in a &ldquo;Buzz Marketing&rdquo; grant through NSLS and has selected our SelfCheck as a service to promote. Thus far, the results have exceeded our goal.
      </p>
      <h3>
       OTHER PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES
      </h3>
      <p style="text-align: left">
       I chaired the Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors Scholarship Committee meeting at which we selected four high school seniors to receive college scholarships. (4/20) Do The Dewey, our annual fundraiser, planning took much of my time the week of 4/16, leading up to the event on 4/21. On 4/23 I attended the meeting of the NSLS Board of Directors at the University Center in Grayslake. On 4/24 I chaired the CCS Database Management TaskForce and attended the Friends of the Library Roundtable meeting. On 4/26 I attended the Library Production Studio Executive Committee meeting and the City of Des Plaines Superstar Awards banquet (at which our Teen Advisory Board won the award for teen volunteers!). On 4/27 the library hosted a reception with entertainment to honor the library's volunteers.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       April 30 through May 2, along with Trustees Eldon Burk and Elaine Tejcek and Coordinator of Computer and Technical Services Hector Marino, I attended the annual Library Legislative Day in Washington, DC. We were able to learn about the national issues affecting libraries, from internet filtering to the LSTA budget, that we would like the congress to address. We were able to meet with representatives of Peter Roskam, Jan Schakowsky, Dick Durbin, and Barack Obama. Peter Roskam left a committee meeting to meet us in the hallway to discuss a variety of issues. Barack Obama's General Counsel spoke at the Illinois delegation's dinner on May 1.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       On 5/8 I attended a CCS Governing Board Forum on Uniformity and Autonomy, on 4/9 the CCS Executive Committee meeting (my term on this body ends June 30), and on 5/10, the Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors meeting before the annual staff in-service day.
