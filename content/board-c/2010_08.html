      <p>
       Circulation has decreased, year to date, but this is compared to 2009, which was a very large increase over circulation in 2008. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s too early to tell if this is a leveling off of a one year spike or the beginning of a trend. It bears watching closely and checking with other libraries for comparisons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only 57.2% of the residents of Des Plaines have library cards. The recent drop in numbers is the result of a one-time purge of cards that expired over three years ago, but carried fines of under $5. Attempts to increase this number have failed thus far; new approaches are called for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Attendance (door count) is down for the month of July, but year to date has increased by 13%. Thus far in 2010, 463 meetings have been held in our meeting rooms by community groups. We will recommend a charge for meeting room use for the 2011 Budget. Estimating a decrease of 33% because of the charges and using a two-tiered charge ($25 for room only; $50 for use of the projection equipment and/or pantry), the library could derive around $10,000 in revenue from these charges.
      </p>
      <p>
       22,945 people visited our website in July, using it over 54,000 times. In-house computer use is down from last July, but up slightly for the year. Use of our online databases is down significantly (nearly 20%).
