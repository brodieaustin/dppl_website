Heidi presented a short program on the new Virtual Reference Service that will be a new addition to services the library offers. Heidi reported that the Des Plaines Public Library as well as 11 other libraries are participating in this new service.

New fiction would be moved closer to the readerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s services desk so staff could assist patrons with their requests and new non-fiction would be moved to the fourth floor.

John Burke offered to try and solicit the expertise and equipment from a local lighting firm.            </p>            <h3>              MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ellen Yearwood, Chairman.            </h3>            <p>              Inara Brubaker reported that the Management Committee met on April 26, 2001.

The average for the month of April was 1410, with 13 days of over 1500 attendance, including a high of 1986 on April 16 (Easter Monday).

Our Work Analysis/Design Team is studying what we do, across departmental lines, to provide customer service. We hired Cate McNeely, Director of the Richmond (B.C.) Public Library, which has gained national attention for customer service innovations, to provide a one-day consulting visit to our library. And, we will work with Peopleworks to design an orientation/training program for the Circulation Services Department, based on the values of customer service as articulated through our policies and practices.            </p>            <p>              Date Due slips will be attached to all incoming books by Baker &amp; Taylor, Ingram, and BWI as part of our processing services.
