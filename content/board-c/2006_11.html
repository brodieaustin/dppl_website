Under the direction of consultant Gail Johnson of Face2Face Communications, we worked on developing a deeper level of trust, as described by Patrick Lencioni in The Five Dysfunctions of a Team. We met at the Friendship Park Conservatory in Des Plaines.<br />              <br />              Several staff have attended workshops at the North Suburban Library System, the topics include parliamentary procedure and future thinking for customer service by Cate McNeely.<br />              <br />              We have recently become members of the Illinois Management Association, which includes the benefits of membersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ rates for their training seminars.            </p>            <h3>              PATRON SERVICES            </h3>            <p>              We are maintaining an increase in the number of items circulated year to date (3%), with 3.5% in October over one year ago. At this rate, we will hit the million mark by the end of November. Patrons used self-check for 19% of the total items circulated from the library building. Print materials accounted for 52% of the total items circulated. Please note the rapidly diminishing circulation of the VHS format. When we decide to discontinue offering this format, we will have considerably more space to shelve DVDs, which are rapidly increasing in circulation. The other transition that we should watch is the flat and/or decreasing circulation of cds. These changes occur naturally as new formats become popular and affordable for our patrons.<br />              <br />              Attendance at the library has increased by 13.7%, but attendance at programs has decreased. Computer use in the adult department increased by 27% and in the youth department by 111%.            </p>            <h3>              OTHER PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES            </h3>            <p>              On October 18, Veronica Schwartz and I traveled to Springfield to attend the banquet at which Des Plaines received the GovernorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Home Town Award for the VeteranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s troop support activities.
