       William Finnerty resigned his position on June 5. Bill recently completed his education for pharmacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Karen Wallace, Head of Community Services has submitted her resignation, effective July 1. We are all sad to think of work in this organization without Karen, because she has made remarkable contributions in every phase of our work together. Karen and her husband, a recent law school graduate, will return to Des Moines, IA, to be nearer their families, who need them now, and to begin her husband's law practice. Karen has accepted a position as Librarian in the Drake University Law Library.
      </p>

       Staff Committees are working hard to anticipate problems and to organize the imminent move in order to minimize anxiety and maximize efficiency and enjoyment. Cow Times is an occasional publication of one committee that accepts concerns, researches topics and answers questions. The Fun committee has produced and managed several games and contests so that friendly competition between departments serves as a stress-reliever. The annual inservice day is planned for June 29. The topic of the day will be Moving Safely and Serenely. We have planned for back training/safe lifting sessions, a mid-day barbecue, an all staff organizing time, and a finale that includes an appropriate farewell to 841 Graceland.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sharon Colby's work with the Department Heads has produced very strong results. We have improved our meeting skills, added new techniques to help determine where decisions are appropriate and to help make better decisions in areas that are most in need of management level decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our patrons have given us a pleasant surprise this month. Circulation increased by nearly 7% while all else seems to be winding down. My interpretation of this change is that the library is on people's minds more lately because of the excellent publicity we are receiving. Please note the shift in meeting room use from public programs to meetings, meeting, and meetings. The Ceremonial Book Move on June 11 was successful in every sense, but it required nearly weekly meetings to manage all the details that helped the operation come off smoothly.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to several meetings of the Ceremonial Move, Preview Party, and the Grand Opening Committees, Sandra met with Eldon Burk and John Burke and representatives of the Executive Service Corps to discuss possible board development services for ESC. Sandra attended a Chamber of Commerce monthly breakfast, a retirement luncheon for Jack Klaus, City Economic Development Director, the Mayor's Prayer Breakfast on May 25, the recognition banquet for Oakton Community College's literacy volunteers on May 31, a Finance Committee Meeting on June 1. On June 6, Eldon Burk and Sandra met with a delegation of library personnel from Sarawak, Malaysia; the group included the Secretary of State of Sarawak as well. They were interested in touring public libraries in Chicago area and selected ours because it was under construction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next Board meeting will be held at Maine West High School in the Principal's Conference Room.
