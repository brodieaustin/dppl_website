       DIRECTOR'S REPORT
      </h2>
      <p>
       Please note: This is an abbreviated report because I am writing it early in the month, before I leave on vacation. I will augment this report in person during the Board Meeting on February 17, as appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please note: I have received no official requests for confidential patron information since my last report.

       STAFF DEVELOPMENT
      </h2>
      <p>
       Sara McLaughlin attended ALA Midwinter meetings in Denver, CO, January 22 &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; 28. She serves as chair of a standing committee. Two staff members are enrolled in the annual Computers in Libraries conference in Arlington, VA. Registration has begun for ALA Annual Conference, which will be held in Chicago this July. Our next All-Staff meeting is scheduled for March 5, 2009.
      </p>
      <h2>
       PATRON SERVICES
      </h2>
      <p>
       Patrons have adjusted well to the construction upheaval in the atrium. They have expressed appreciation of the new self-serve holds, and are eager to use the new self-check machines and the automated sorter. As of 2/4, we are prepared to open the self-checks. We will open the automated sorter soon thereafter, once the patron side is working reliably. The staff induction side is working very well. We are already observing changes in work patterns and will adjust our staffing accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Circulation decreased this January as compared to January 2008, perhaps due to the unusually cold weather. The lower self-check use is a result of our dismantling the two units on the first floor for the month of January. Services that showed an increase in use are: use of adult computers and online searches.
      </p>
      <h2>
       OTHER PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES
      </h2>
      <p>
       I attended an exciting Family Literacy Night at Orchard Place School on January 22, representing Rotary. Rotary Club of Des Plaines presented 350 books to the children in attendance. The PTO raffled off three family nonresident library card (paying the 25% not covered by Rosemont) to three very pleased families.
      </p>
      <p>
       I attended the Friends of the Library meeting on 1/27, The CCS Governing Board meeting on 1/28, a Do the Dewey organizing meeting on 2/3 and the Chamber of Commerce Executive Board meeting on2/4. I plan to attend the NSLS Legislative Breakfast on February 16.

      <p>
       I will be on vacation from February 5 through 15.

       NEW BUSINESS
      </h2>
      <p>
       Dan Klobnak, Outsource Solutions Group, presented three quotes to the board for the proposed library wireless project. He recommended Norman Electrical Construction for cabling, which was the lowest proposal in the amount of $5,900.00, CDW-G for the hardware, which was the lowest proposal in the amount of $14,500.00 and WaveTeam for the installation, testing and training in the amount of $7,500.00. This was not the lowest proposal, but Dan Klobnak explained that the services offered by the lowest proposal listed were not what was needed for the project. Rhys Read and Matthew Bogusz asked why this project was not offered through a bid process and Sandra Norlin responded that a Request for Proposal was the usual library practice for this type of project and that the library follows practices and procedures similar to those of the City of Des Plaines. Matthew Bogusz stated that he considers this project a construction project over $10,000.00. Sandra Norlin did not agree. The Board discussed the library wireless project.

       Elaine Tejcek reported that the Art Committee met on February 3, 2009 and continued their discussion for the proposed mural project for the wall of the parking garage that leads to the library. Elaine reported that Sandra Norlin received a telephone call from Jason Bajor, City Manager, who asked Sandra to meet with John Laux, Acting Head of Public Works and Mike Spiel, Director of Building and Code to discuss lighting and maintenance of the mural before placing this item on the consent agenda for the City of Des Plaines.

      <p>
       Elaine also reported that the Art Committee continued their discussion on the purchase and installation of a video display unit for one wall in the youth services department. This equipment would be used to highlight the artworks of the children in the community. This project would be solely funded by the Des Plaines Public Library Donation account. Elaine reported that Holly Richards Sorensen, Assistant Director, and Heather Imhoff, Head of Public Information Services, will attend the Friends of the Library meeting on Tuesday, February 24, to ask the Friends if they would consider donating the funds for this project. If the Friends do not donate the funds for this project, the Des Plaines Public Library donation account will be used for this purchase.

       Heather Imhoff, Head of Public Information, distributed information for the proposed Video Display System to be installed on all floors of the library to promote programs and services. Heather reported that the costs for the Youth Services project and the Video Display System were combined, which resulted in a better price for each systems. Rhys Read and Matthew Bogusz asked if this system was offered to vendors through the bid process and Sandra Norlin reported that a Request for Proposal was used for the pricing and three vendors were contacted.
