While attendance at the library was nearly identical to last July, our circulation increased by 5.63%. Of the 99,124 items checked out, 46% were audiovisual materials. Patrons used self-check for 25% of the transactions. This high rate of use of our materials may be the result of our successful Summer Reading Club activities for children and adults. 1354 children enrolled in the program; 665 met their reading goals. The 135 adults who entered the program read a total of 759 books in six weeks. Interlibrary loan transactions continue to increase each month, so it is time for us to address our lending protocols, so that our lending is similar to other CCS libraries. CCS has a new member library. The Evanston Public Library became a member in July and will become a full participant in 2005. This will add a good collection of materials for our patrons to access through the shared catalog. Please note the large increases in computer assistance provided by the Adult Services staff.            </p>            <p>              Project Next Generation is a continuing grant program through the office of Secretary of State Jesse White. This is our third year of offering this program to middle school students. This year eight children participated in creative learning activities to strengthen their problem-solving, reasoning, computer, and teamwork skills. Their final event is a bus trip to the Illinois State Fair, where they and their families will enjoy an evening of free entertainment courtesy of the grant and the Secretary of State.            </p>            <h3>              OTHER PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES            </h3>            <p>              I attended the CCS Governing Board meeting on July 28.
