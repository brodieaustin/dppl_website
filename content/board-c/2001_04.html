The Work Analysis Team (Bob Blanchard, Mei-Na Chen, Kathy Kyrouac, Vee Luz, Chris Posinger, Pauline Simo, and David Whittingham) has begun their work in describing the work that we do. The next steps will include analyzing these functions by process and designing a plan to improve processes to improve customer service.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "Lighting the Fire" project is a grant from the State Library to develop creative grants from the system member libraries. We have the opportunity to apply for a small grant of $5,000 for a project of our choosing. Margie Borris is the staff person in charge of facilitating the process for our library. The grant idea the Department Heads group is endorsing is a cataloging/digitization project for our circulating art collection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please note that our collection is growing gradually, with the book collection over 200,000. Our voluntary limit on DVDs is working well. We have received one written complaint, but several verbal positive comments. The DVD circulation continues to increase. Our registered borrowers are nearly 70% of our population and our attendance continues to rise. Year to date, the attendance has increased 43% over last year at this time. Our circulation has increased by 10% year to date over 2000 and March's rate is 14% higher than last March. Children's materials make up 39% of our circulation year to date. Self-check use continues to be substantially higher than last year. In March the self-check circulation was 19% of the total circulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meeting Room use remains very high. In March 97 library programs were offered and 46 community groups used our facilities for meetings or programs. The total attendance at all programs in March was 3,675.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eldon Burk raised the issue of ongoing complaints about the new system of eliminating date stamps in each item checked out. This topic bears further discussion by the full board.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandra Norlin met with John Burke, Walter Roth and other ESC consultants to plan the Board Retreat, the City Holiday Decorations Committee to plan this winter's Holiday Lighting Ceremony, attended the mayoral candidate's forum, the CCS Governing Board meeting, participated in the Work Design team training workshop, the Live And Learn Innovation Grant training, the Socrates Rand Dinner, and modeled for the third year in the Des Plaines Junior Women's Club Fashion Show.

       NEW BUSINESS
      </h2>
      <p>
       Sandra Norlin reported that the City Council will meet on May 7, 2001 to discuss the library lease for the 1501 Ellinwood building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandra reported that she received three citizen opinion forms. Eldon Burk asked what procedure is followed when the forms are received. Sandra Norlin responded that she reviews the complaints and then forwards them to the library Committee responsible for ordering the materials. The Committee decides if the material in question is within the collection development policy guidelines. Sandra reported that the materials in question were within the collection development policy guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Board discussed reintroducing the date due slips for all library materials. Inara Brubaker asked Sandra how other libraries have adjusted to the lack of date due slips on their materials and Sandra Norlin responded that some people may never adjust to the lack of the slips, but that self check has increased at the library, the books returned can be shelved faster and patrons can go to the library website to find out when their books are due. William Grice stated that if patrons want their materials due date stamped by the staff, the library should comply. Eldon Burk stated that he wants all materials to have the date due strip attached. Ellen Yearwood stated that the patrons would adjust to the lack of the date due slip. The Board concurred that the date due strip should be on all library materials. Sandra Norlin will proceed with this.
