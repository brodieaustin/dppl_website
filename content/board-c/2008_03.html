It's called The Morning Report and uses an enewsletter format.                        </p>                        <h3>                            PATRON SERVICES                        </h3>                        <p>                            February was an interesting month. Although attendance was down by 8% over February, 2007, circulation increased by 8.27%. The circulation from the main library increased by 8% and from the Mobile Library by 13%. Self-check was used for 44% of the items checked out of the main library. Print circulation accounted for 51% of the total circulation, 68% of the Youth Services circulation and 42% of the Adult Services circulation. Current registration for library cards represents 62.2% of the population of Des Plaines, a slight (123) decrease from 2007.<br />                            <br />                            If we divide the use of the library equally among the 29 days we were open in February, we get a picture of a “typical “ day at the library. In February, that would be 249 uses of the computers in the adult services department, 53 uses of computers in the youth services department; 31 people using the group study rooms; 128 items reserved for patrons to pick up; 518 uses of our electronic databases; and 129 people attending meetings or programs; and 3208 items checked out. That's just one day in February.<br />                            <br />                            Please note the new information about programming and other services provided outside the library by library staff. In February, 1078 people had contact with the library through these services.<br />                            <br />                            I want to call attention to the extraordinary generosity of the Friends of the Library. The Friends have recently agreed to fund several new initiatives and programs, including our new reusable “shopping” bag program, design services for a special home page for the teens, and an additional program through the Friends Family Sunday series.                        </p>                        <h3>                            OTHER PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES                        </h3>                        <p>                            I attended a meeting to discuss cooperative grant potential at the Frisbie Senior Center on 2/27 and a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Library Production Studio on 2/28.
