Although the usage in nearly all areas of service was down in 2007 as compared to 2006, we still have a very good rate of service to our community. For example, over 100,125 requests for service were answered by staff at the public service desk on the first floor; 75,805 requests were served on the second floor; and 113,255 requests were served on the 3rd and 4th floors. With a total of 289,185 person-to-person services provided, that is an average of 5 per resident. Our public meeting rooms were used 1,489 times by 78,891 people throughout the year. That number of people would fill Soldier Field, with 17,000+ people in standing room. It would fill US Cellular Field or Wrigley Field twice or the United Center 3 Ã‚Â½ times.
