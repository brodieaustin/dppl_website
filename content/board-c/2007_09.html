This month 62% of the youth services circulation was for print materials; 43% of the items circulated from the adult collection was for print material. Overall, print materials account for 49% of the total number of items circulated in August.<br />              <br />              Carol Kidd has added a chart indicating the use of public computers during the past two and the current years. Christina Tropea has submitted a report explaining the reasons that our database use statistics show a decline. The essence of her report is to state that we now have a more accurate and appropriate way of counting the uses of our databases, but that they will show a decline for the next year when compared with the earlier way the information was collected and reported. Her report is included in the board packet.            </p>            <h3>              OTHER PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES            </h3>            <p>              I attended two Chamber of Commerce events: a fundraiser on 8/22 and the monthly board meeting on 9/13.
