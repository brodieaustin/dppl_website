We are catching up in circulation transactions with a very healthy 4.5% increase for the month of May. Self-check now accounts for 50% of all items checked out of the main library, far exceeding our goal of 35% by July 1. Our patron attendance was down by 16% and our number of registered card holders decreased slightly. In person assistance increased in specific items requested, the virtual (online) reference, and Interlibrary Loans, but use of our databases has decreased significantly. We have had difficulty getting reliable figures from one of the most popular databases, the Gale Group. I hope to have clarification by June 19.<br />              <br />              The balance of circulation between print and non-print materials continues to tilt toward increasing circulation of non-print. This month the overall balance was even. Sixty-three percent of the Youth Services materials circulated was print items, while 43% of the Adult Services materials was print.<br />              <br />              We are experiencing very high registration for our summer reading clubs. In the week and a half since registration opened, 1015 children, 97 adults, and 35 teens have registered.<br />              <br />              We have received honorable mention in the American Library Association LPercy awards for our centennial calendar.
