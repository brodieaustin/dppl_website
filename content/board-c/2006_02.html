The topic is Health Information and Healthy Work and Life Habits. In addition to information on personal health, we will hold a demonstration on how to align our task chairs properly, followed by alignment of keyboards and monitors. The ergonomic instructions are the result of a screening completed by a representative of the CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (and LibraryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s) Workers Compensation insurance carrier, Gallagher Bassett, and the report she submitted outlining corrective actions for the library to take.<br />            <br />            The Library staff will participate in the Relay for Life activities during the weekend of June 17-18. Library Trustees are invited to join us in our efforts, through walking, sponsoring, and donating. This is the fourth year we have participated.            <h3>              PATRON SERVICES            </h3>            <p>              We have begun the year busier in nearly all departments than we were one year ago. Circulation of materials has increased by 5.2%, with circulation of print items accounting for 52% of the total items checked out. Patrons used the self-check equipment to check out 20% of the items from the main library. InÃ¢â‚¬â€œperson assistance from staff increased in all areas of the library, although ReadersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Services use was down in Adult Services. Computer use was up in all areas, including staff assistance. There was a dramatic increase in use of the libraryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s electronic databases (71%). Checkouts from the Mobile Library decreased by 25%, due, no doubt, to the fact that the vehicle was out of service from January 3 through the 7th.<br />              <br />              Attendance at the library was up by nearly 12% and program and meeting room use increased by 14%. We continue to increase the number of card holders as well. This January we have 502 more cardholders than in January 2005.<br />              <br />              Please note the graphs that show circulation and attendance at the library from 2001 through 2005. You will see that our growth in use was steady through 2003, when the use began to taper off or hold. During this same time the use of our computers and the computer services has increased dramatically.<br />              <br />              We have included charts on the use of materials in languages other than English for your information. These charts show that, although second in population in Des Plaines, readers who speak and read Polish as their first language check out over twice as many books as residents who speak and read Spanish, Gujarati, and Russian. It is interesting to note that readers of Spanish have increased significantly their use of non-fiction materials.            </p>            <h3>              OTHER PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES            </h3>            <p>              Since my last report I have attended the Chamber of Commerce Orientation meeting (1/18), the Library Cable Network (LCN) Executive Committee meeting (1/18), the MayorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Address to Business breakfast program (1/19), the Taste of Des Plaines organizing meeting (1/19), chaired the Do the Dewey 2006 committee meeting (1/24), the Friends of the Library Roundtable meeting (1/24), chaired the CCS Governing BoardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Annual Meeting, at which I gave the Ã¢â‚¬Å“State of the Intergovernmental Instrumentality AddressÃ¢â‚¬ (1/25), chaired the CCS Database Management Task Force, gave a brief presentation at the Hispanic Advisory CouncilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Leadership Development Meeting (2/1), attended the Chamber of Commerce Dinner Dance, at which I was introduced as a new member of the Board of Directors (2/3), chaired the CCS Executive Committee (2/8), attended the Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors meeting (2/9).
