Their remarks were challenging they addressed the new reality for libraries in the United States. Presentations like this are very useful to start conversations and idea-generating sessions among our staff so that we can creatively solve the problems we face at this time, i.e. cuts in funding, competition for scarce public resources, and, the lower esteem that libraries and librarians are held in by vocal members of our communities.

Interlibrary Loan decreased by 72%, van delivery by 27%, and overall circulation by 7.35%. Van delivery options are being studied by a Task Force of North Suburban Libraries and by the library systems that are planning to merge in 2011. The current, but temporary van delivery service will end sometime in October.                        </p>                        <p>                            Sixty-seven percent of the items that circulated from the childrenâ€™s collection were print materials, whereas 44% of the items circulated from the adult collection were print.

Two of our childrenâ€™s programs attracted of 200 attendees, and one over 100. The average attendance for the other ten programs was 46, with 16 the lowest and 88 the highest.

The library also visits local schools, preschools, congregant residential facilities in Des Plaines. Thus far in 2010, we have presented programs to 6,070 people in Des Plaines.
