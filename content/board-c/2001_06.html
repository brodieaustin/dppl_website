The analysis and comparison information from the Illinois State Library Public Library Statistics included in the board packets demonstrates that the Des Plaines Public Library's use of funds and its public use of the services compares well to our surrounding libraries and to other libraries throughout the state that fall within profiles selected by the Library Research Center at the University of Illinois. Once again, our library compares favorably in what we produce for the budget we operate.

All of us who were connected with this grant have received gratification from the experience because of how effective it was in fulfilling its goals of giving a group of individuals a voice to express themselves and giving the library staff the opportunity to hear and witness the depth of feelings of worthiness of the young women who participated. I think this was the perfect use of grant monies, because it allowed us to try something creative with a group of people who might not otherwise have been served through our normal operating budget.                        </p>                        <p>                            Another activity worth noting is the outstanding effort put forth by the Youth Services Staff in conducting library tours for over 1400 6, 7, and 8<sup>th</sup> graders during the month of May. As you can tell from the letter included in your packet, these efforts have had very positive results.                        </p>                        <p>                            Since my last report I have represented the library at the following meetings and events: On May 16 I attended the meeting of the city Holiday Decorations Committee; on May 21 City Council, on May 22 the Annual Meeting of the Friends of the Library, on May 23 the Chicago Building Congress Awards Ceremony, on May 29 the Chamber/City Advisory Council, on May 30 the NSLS Library Trustees Meeting, on June 1 I conducted a tour of the library for Anders Dahlgren's Library Building Planning class from Dominican University, on June 6 I along with Holly Richards Sorensen, Roberta Johnson, and Sarah Long, taped three more segments of the Library Cable Network's "Check in @ your Library", on June 11 the District 62 Community Education Council meeting and the MERC Unity Dinner.
