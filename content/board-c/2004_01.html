Sandra Norlin reported that City Attorney David Wiltse recommended contacting Gallagher Bassett, the administrator for the City of Des Plaines insurance plan to assess the situation.

       Sandra Norlin asked that V.E.1. Administrator's Report be removed from the Consent Agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandra Norlin asked that the Administrator's Report for January 20, 2004 be corrected to "Our total collection includes 292,848 items, 250,457 (86%) of which are books, so we, like most other public libraries, show 44% of our circulation from 14% of our collection."
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandra Norlin reported that the construction on the Heritage Room may begin the week of January 19, 2004, with a completion date of March 2, 2004.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandra Norlin also reported that the cost of a floor to ceiling mural for the Children's Storytime Room will be $8,000.00. Sandra will ask for financial support for this project from the Friends of the Library.

      </p>
      <p>
       Sandra Norlin reported that the library incurred expenses that were not anticipated after hosting the City of Des Plaines New Year's Eve celebration. President Lake will send a letter to Mayor Arredia asking for reimbursement of these costs.

      <p>
       Sandra Norlin reported that book carts normally stored in the Circulation Services hallway are in violation of the fire code and must be moved. Sandra has met with staff and several options have been discussed.

      <h3>
       PATRON SERVICES
      </h3>
      <p>
       The big news this month is the continuing increase in use of our materials and facilities. Each year since we opened the new library we have increased our circulation from the previous year by over 12% (12.66; 12.7; and 12.08 %), for a total increase from the beginning of 2000 to the end of 2003 of 44%. In 2003, patrons have used self-check for 23% of all circulation. Audio-visual items account for 44% of the total circulation, 32% of children's and 52% of adults'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our total collection includes 292,848 items, 250,457( 86% ) of which are books, so we, like most other public libraries, show 44% of our circulation from 16% of our collection.
      </p>
      <p>
       We passed a milestone in 2003 by circulating over 1 million items to our library patrons.
      </p>
      <h3>
       OTHER PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES
