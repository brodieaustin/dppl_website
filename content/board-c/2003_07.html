The conference attendance was approximately 8,000 less than expected following the W.H.O. warning about travel to Toronto because of the number of SARS cases reported there. Both Hector and Holly serve on ALA committees, Membership and International Relations, respectively. This year's conference was notable for two national issues that were pertinent to librarians. One was the announcement of the Supreme Court decision favoring the CIPA and the other was the growing controversy over libraries and librarians in Cuba in the aftermath of the recent harsh treatment of dissidents in Cuba.                        </p>                        <p>                            I awarded tuition reimbursement to five employees for fall semester classes. One other employee received an earlier award for the spring semester. Three of the recipients are working for Masters' degrees, and three are working on Bachelor's degrees.                        </p>                        <h3>                            PATRON SERVICES                        </h3>                        <p>                            There were no inquiries concerning patron records in June.                        </p>                        <p>                            The demand for our services continues to increase. Our circulation is up by 14% year to date over the same period last year. Items checked out in June increased 16% over June last year. Our Summer Reading Club enrollment is also higher than last year. Well over 1200 children are participating in the annual event. Patrons used self-check services to check out 23% of all materials in June. Youth Services checkouts comprised 36% of the total checkouts for the month. Mobile Library circulation increased by 14% over last June, and comprised 3% of the total circulation of all library materials.                        </p>                        <p>                            The virtual reference service, now called "MyWebLibrarian" ended as a grant project officially on June 30. The service will continue, thanks to the efforts of library staff in the North Suburban libraries. We have nine staff members trained to provide this 24/7 online reference service for eight hours during the week and one out of three Sundays for four hours. Heidi Krueger, Adult Services Librarian, served on the steering committee and continues to serve as liaison for this joint project. During its heaviest month, April 2003, librarians assisted in over 3,000 reference inquiries. The program began in January, 2001. Our service is third in the country in volume of inquiries, behind Q&amp;A NJ and Clevenet's Know-It-Now.                        </p>                        <p>                            Chris Posinger reported on the successful public program, "A Tribute to Mae West." Ninety-two people attended and were uniformly pleased with the presentation. Eighty-five percent rated it excellent and 15% rated it above average.                        </p>                        <p>                            A crew of over 20 staff, family and Trustees marched in the Fourth of July parade.

I attended two meetings of the Friends of the Library, June 24 and July 1. On June 29 I attended the opening celebration for the Skokie Public Library's addition and renovation. I walked with the staff and trustees in the library's entry for the 4th of July parade, and attended an all-day workshop on Excel 2002(XP) on July 9.                        </p>                        <p>                            I plan to take vacation July 16 through 21, but will attend a Library Advocacy Program at NSLS on Monday, July 21.                        </p>                        <h2>                            OLD BUSINESS                        </h2>                        <p>                            President Ciborowski distributed the results from the Community Focus Groups and explained how the information was compiled and how the participants were chosen.
