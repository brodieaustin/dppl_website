A 4.05% increase in items circulated included fiction and DVDs from the Youth Services collection and small increases in non-fiction, CDs and DVDs from the Adult Collection. Please note the low circulation of videocassettes, which will be weeded out during the coming year. The low use of the collection does not justify the large share of shelf space it requires. Overall, the print materials accounted for 52% of the circulation. AV items account for 15% of the total collection and 48% of the circulation.                        </p>                        <p>                            The door count increased from last October by 14% and meeting room attendance significantly (60%).
