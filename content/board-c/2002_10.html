Hector Marino gave a presentation, Barbara Saletnik and Margie Borris gave Poster Sessions, and Veronica Schwartz gave a Table Talk. Martha Sloan attended a workshop sponsored by the Public Library Association on the new PLA planning process, Planning for Results, presented by the author of the handbook, Sandra Nelson. Carol Kidd attended a one-day seminar on communication skills. I attended ILA as well as the annual Pegasus Conference on Systems Management in San Diego, CA.                        </p>                        <p>                            By every measurement of activity, library use has increased over use a year ago. Registration is up to 71% of the population; circulation is up by 11%; attendance is up 21%; staff assistance to patrons has increased in all departments; the use of self-check represented 22% of the circulation from the main library; and the intrepid Youth Services staff has handed out train sets for Thomas the Tank Engine nearly 9,000 times since January 1. Our collection is growing at a healthy pace, with books totaling 236,520 and the total collection at 276,635.                        </p>                        <p>                            In addition to regular monthly and weekly meetings, I enjoyed two exceptionally good conferences. The ILA Conference in Chicago offered many opportunities to be inspired (Sarah Long's Keynote Address about the future of libraries and librarians and author Sara Paretsky's luncheon address about the dangers to freedom of expression from the loss of small and family-owned presses to a few large conglomerate, international publishing houses and the incursion on privacy through the USAPATRIOT Act); informed (technology trends, forgotten books from the 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s, Spanish language programming for children, and the planning process); and refreshed by many opportunities to network with colleagues.                        </p>                        <p>                            The Pegasus Conference, "Leading in a Complex World: Systems Thinking in Action," was a full three-day conference that lived up to its promises of refreshing my understanding of the Learning Organization principles, deepening my understanding of Systems Thinking, learning new skills that support the learning organization principles, and reaching a deeper understanding of leadership. The opening plenary session was a combination of a dramatic portrayal of the Ernest Shackelton adventure and a "caf&eacute; table" conversation for over 700 participants. This was an international conference, with attendees from several foreign countries, including Singapore, Egypt, Germany, Iceland, Sweden, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Saudi Arabia. The sessions were physically designed to facilitate guided conversations, which is the technique highly recommended for understanding and communicating complicated issues and perplexing problems. We all participated in preparing and presenting ideas for a new system of education that prepares all children to be thoughtful contributors to the new, fast-paced, global environment. Illinois was well-represented by The Breakthrough Group, which presented the Shackelton drama and Stephanie Pace Marshall, founder and President of the Illinois Math and Science Academy, who spoke on "Generative Learning: Transforming Our Schools to Transform the World." Peter Senge, the author of The Fifth Discipline; Joseph Jaworski, the author of Synchronicity; Otto Scharmer; and Adam Kahane led the final session. We really did spend three days talking about transforming the world through deliberative conversation and leadership.                        </p>                        <h4>                            NEW BUSINESS                        </h4>                        <p>                            MOTION by Committee to approve revisions to Section B - Material Selection Policy, General Statement (B-1); and to approve, as written, Gifts and Endowments (B-3), Donor Form (B-3A) and Section D - Personnel Policy, Guidelines for Tuition Reimbursement (D-8, G.); and to review Section B - Material Selection Policy, Material Selection Principles (B-2) at the November 19, 2002 Board of Trustees meeting.
