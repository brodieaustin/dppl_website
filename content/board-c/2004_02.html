We had a decrease in overall attendance. Both of these changes might be attributed to the unusually cold weather in January. Patrons used Self-Check for 25% of our circulation in January. Our Audio Visual circulation was 45% of the total circulation, 31% of Youth Services circulation and 53% of Adult Circulation.            </p>            <p>              Trends to watch are the decrease in videocassette circulation and increase in DVD circulation in both Adult and Youth collections; the declining checkouts of periodicals; and the decrease in circulation of framed art. The Adult Services Department is planning a display of framed art to bring the collection to the attention of our patrons.            </p>            <p>              Our registered cardholders represent 65% of the population of Des Plaines. Susan Farid inquired about the purging practices of surrounding libraries and learned that Elk Grove Village and Mt. Prospect purge patron files once a year, Park Ridge purges every two years, and Niles has no set time currently, but is planning to use a once a year cycle. We purge our records monthly as of three months ago.            </p>            <p>              Phyllis Johnson reports that our Rosemont Mobile Library stops are going well.
