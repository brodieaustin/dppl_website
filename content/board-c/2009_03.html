MOTION CARRIED.            </p>            <p>              Don Sofolo, Owner, Outsource Solutions Group, explained why an additional payment of $970.00 was being requested to pay CDW-G for Hardware for the Library Wireless Project. Mr. Sofolo explained that upon placing orders for the hardware, CDW-G was informed that the hardware vendor, Nomadix, changed their licensing / pricing policy. As of January 1, 2009, Nomadix bundled the hardware, and the operating license with a Premium Support package, which includes 24/7 support as well as next day replacement of hardware. This change in policy caused an increase in cost.            </p>            <p>              <b>MOTION</b> by Eldon Burk, seconded by Elaine Tejcek, to approve an additional payment of an amount not to exceed $1,000 to CDW-G for Hardware for the Library Wireless Project, which is a budgeted expense and is in the best interest of the Des Plaines Public Library. <b>ROLL CALL VOTE:</b> AYES: Burk, DÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Souza, Klebe, Lake, Magerl, Read, Tejcek.
