       The transition of employment from the library to Outsource Solutions Group took place successfully on January 2. All eight library employees in IT Services were given the opportunity to make the transition. All but one chose to be employed by Outsource Solutions Group.

       STAFF DEVELOPMENT
      </h3>
      <p>
       The Circulation Services Staff, led by Susan Farid and Mei-Na Chen, deserve special recognition for their flexibility, cooperation, and good will during their recent move out of and back into the circulation workroom as the construction progressed for the remodeling project.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole staff cooperated in preparing our collection with RFID tags, a project that is nearly complete. The first phase involved tagging adult fiction and non-fiction books from the adult collection. That phase was completed remarkably quickly and provided an opportunity for staff members to work in pairs with staff from other departments. The last portion of the collection to be tagged is the music collection and is nearly completed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Readers Service staff member Cathy Friedman has worked with Jason Slowinski, Assistant City Manager, to prepare an application for a Public Library Innovation Grant from the ICMA (International City/County Management Association) for a joint project to gather information about human services programs for local residents in one location and to make it accessible at the library and at city hall as well on both the city&acirc;&euro;&trade;s and library&acirc;&euro;&trade;s websites. The deadline for application was January 9; awards will be announced in February.
