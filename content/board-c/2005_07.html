Ninety-two staff members rode chartered buses to McCormick Place to view the exhibits of library goods and services as part of the ALA Annual Conference. We obtained free passes to the exhibits from Demco, a longtime supplier of library supplies and equipment. Martha Sloan chaired the staff committee who carefully planned the day and provided an educational and enjoyable experience for all attendees. Carol Kidd deserves special recognition for her managing of all the logistical details, from chartering the buses, obtaining the passes, preparing the applications in advance so that our staff did not have to wait in long registration lines, to shopping for and arranging for food for the day.<br />            </p>            <p>              Staff Bonus Awards were presented to Carol Kidd, Chris Posinger, and Gail Bradley for the second quarter.

Sandra explained that the Village of Rosemont pays 75% toward the cost of a Des Plaines library card and asks Rosemont residents to pay the remaining 25%. Sandra also explained that most of these families can not afford to pay the 25%, which is $60.00 and that the Board, according to library law, does not have the authority to give free library cards to people who do not have libraries in their communities. Sandra stated that she has asked for financial assistance from the school district and Rosemont officials, but has not been successful. The Board asked Sandra Norlin to continue to ask for help from the Village of Rosemont and the school district.            </p>            <h2>              ANNOUNCEMENTS            </h2>            <p>              The City of Des Plaines will begin working on a Strategic Plan and will be conducting focus groups.
