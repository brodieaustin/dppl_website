Although there were decreases in numbers of materials checked out and in computer use, these were decreases from some of the all-time high numbers in April 2009, and, thus far we are maintaining an increase from 2009, year to date. Attendance at the library increased in person, and nearly 54,000 people visited the library through our website. You will notice a large decrease in patron card holders. This is the result of a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpurgeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬ of expired library cards that have not been used for three years and have fines of less than $5. We feel that counting those as active cards is misleading. These cards will be purged on a regular monthly basis with all cards that have been expired.            </p>            <p>              You will have heard of the drastic cuts in services through the North Suburban Library System as of May 30, 2010. At this point I am not aware of what services will be cut or curtailed, but we are assured that the van delivery service will be the last service to be affected.            </p>            <h3>              OTHER PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES            </h3>            <p>              I attended the Public Library AdministratorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Forum on April 21 at NSLS where the featured speakers were architects from Engberg Anderson in Milwaukee who have designed LEED certified libraries; on April 23 I chaired the meeting of the Chamber of Commerce Scholarship Committee; on April 24, The 8th Annual Do the Dewey Fundraiser; on April 27 I attended the Friends of the Library roundtable meeting. On April 29 Gary Valente and I joined Security Monitor Rich Simon at the Skokie Courthouse. Mr. Simon is a witness to the incident that occurred on February 28, in which a resident set off smoke bombs in the parking garage and as he was leaving the scene and was asked to stop by Mr. Simon, pulled a mask over his face, crouched down, and pointed a (fake) gun at Mr. Simon. We reported this incident to the police, who responded. Subsequently, the police department filed a complaint, and the stateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s attorney has pressed charges against the man involved. The defendant refused a plea bargain and requested a trial, which will be held on June 2. Gary Valente and I attended to give moral support to Mr. Simon and to be prepared to give information if it was requested. On May 4, Carol Kidd and I attended the site coordinators meeting of Age Options in Oak Park. Age Options coordinates the temporary hiring for seniors who are seeking employment, but who may have been out of the workforce for several years and need to be introduced to the demands of the 21st century workplace. There is no charge to the library for these services, and employees may work up to 12 months at an Age Options approved worksite. I will attend the monthly meeting of the Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors on May 13.            </p>            <h2>              NEW BUSINESS            </h2>            <p>              APPROVE PAYMENT OF VENDOR CHECKS REPORT - $$141,234.14.

Susan Moylan Krey asked if it was necessary to replace the computers and Don Sofolo, President, Outsource Solutions Group, stated that the computers being replaced were purchased between 2003 and 2005 and because of the age of the computer they become less of a productive tool. Susan Moylan Krey asked what will happen to the old computers and Dan Klobnak replied that they are offered to the City of Des Plaines and if refused are then donated to Computers for Schools.            </p>            <p>              <strong>MOTION</strong> by Jennifer Tsalapatanis, seconded by George Magerl, to approve staff workstation replacement in an amount not to exceed $17,000, which is a budgeted expense and in the best interest of the Des Plaines Public Library. <strong>VOTE:</strong> AYES: All.

At the May 17, 2010 Finance Committee meeting Library Director Sandra Norlin reported that she contacted library attorney, Gerard Dempsey, and Mr. Dempsey advised that the library could not secure a bridge loan or line of credit independently, but would have to ask the City of Des Plaines to add the libraryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s request for a line of credit to their request. Jeff stated that the library attorney will be directed to draw up an intergovernmental agreement between the City of Des Plaines and the Des Plaines Public Library so that funds will be available if the library experiences a shortfall before tax revenue is receive in 2010.            </p>            <p>              <strong>MOTION</strong> by Committee, to approve changes to Policy A-10, Bylaws of the Board of Trustees, as presented. <strong>VOTE:</strong> AYES: All.

A plan was put in place to offer van delivery service for three months to system libraries who agree to pay $500 per month to cover overhead and agree to pay a percentage of the total cost for the van delivery service based on each libraryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s portion of the total annual volume of delivery. The payment from the libraries would be considered donations to NSLS and would not be returned to libraries if state money was received by NSLS.            </p>            <p>              President Lake stated that Evanston and Des Plaines libraries have not committed to the van plan. Jeff Rozovics stated that the three month cost to Des Plaines for the temporary van service would be $12,930.00 and this is not in the 2010 library budget. Sandra Norlin was directed to contact library attorney, Gerard Dempsey, to ask if the library could legally make a donation to NSLS. President Lake stated that she was opposed to the plan and that paying NSLS to continue van service would tax Des Plaines residents twice for this service. President Lake stated that Des Plaines was asked to donate the largest amount because we lend out the most materials of any library in the system.            </p>            <p>              Jeff Rozovics stated that the recommendation from the Finance Committee was to authorize the payment of $12,930 for van delivery service for three months for the period June 16 through September 15, 2020, with ratification of this decision by the full board at a regular or special board meeting. Jeff then stated that all information was not available to the Finance Committee when they met on May 17, 2010.            </p>            <p>              The consensus of the board was to not ratify the plan and add this item to the June 15 agenda.            </p>            <h2>              BUILDING AND GROUNDS COMMITTEE REPORT, MAY 18, 2010 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ GEORGE MAGERL.            </h2>            <p>              George Magerl, Chair of the Building and Grounds Committee, reported that the Committee met on April 28, 2010 and recommends that the Board direct library staff to request proposals for replacement of public restroom countertops for four floors with quartz material and to direct library staff to request proposals for the purchase of hand dryers for four floors, including both inexpensive hand dryers and environmentally conscious hand dryers.            </p>            <p>              Jennifer Tsalapatanis suggested using cultured marble for the countertop material, which Jennifer stated costs less than granite.            </p>            <p>              <strong>MOTION</strong> by Committee to direct staff to go out for proposal for countertop replacement with quartz or cultured marble material and to go out for proposal for two different style hand dryers, an inexpensive hand dryer and an environmentally conscious hand dryer. <strong>VOTE:</strong> AYES: All.
