       Susan Weinberg reported that on the fourth floor inappropriate pictures were being printed to the library printers and Susan asked what procedures are followed in these cases. Sandra Norlin replied that patrons are informed that this activity violates library policy. The patrons may be asked to leave the library or are banned from the library if they do not comply.
