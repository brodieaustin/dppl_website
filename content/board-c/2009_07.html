       PERSONNEL

       Mei-Na Chen retired from the position of Page Supervisor, effective 6.26.09.

       STAFF DEVELOPMENT
      </h3>
      <p>
       There are many ways to gauge how individual staff members are developing their skills and knowledge. This month I'd like to point out the recent triumphs of some of our staff's group efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
       On June 26, the annual Cancer Society Relay for Life event was held in Des Plaines, this year in partnership with Park Ridge. Veronica Schwartz, Head of Youth Services, was the Coordinator for this event. The library team, the Book Babes, was led by Cheryl Gladfelter. The fund-raising goal for our team was $5,000, which they surpassed by $600. This year our team was walking the track and raising money to honor the memories of Barbara Saletnik and former team member Kathy Kyrouac, both of whom died within the past year.
      </p>
      <p>
       On July 12, the library's Book Cart Drill Team competed for the "world championship" at the ALA Annual Conference held in Chicago. Before a standing room only crowd of 1,000+ our team performed beautifully and tied for first place. In the end, the Cart Wheels rolled away with the 2nd Place Trophy: a silver book truck supplied by the competition's sponsor, Demco. WBEZ's Gabriel Spitzer covered the event and produced a radio report, which aired on NPR's All Things Considered on July 13.
      </p>
      <p>
       On July 4, the Cart Wheels performed a precision routine in the City's Independence Day Parade. The "Singing Librarians" performed crowd pleasing songs from high atop their float.
      </p>
      <p>
       On July 13, most of the staff (and 3 trustees) rode in two buses to attend the exhibits at the ALA Annual Conference. All the planning and arrangements were handled by the library's In-service Day committee, under the leadership of Holly Sorensen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Holly Sorensen and Joanne Griffin participated in a panel program at the ALA Conference on Civic Engagement. They described the activities that the Des Plaines Public Library has been engaged in since 2002. Their presentation was very well received, especially because the other panelists gave more theoretical and academic presentations.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these efforts show a remarkable esprit de corps, knowledge of logistics, creative drive, and generosity of spirit. The staff have learned by doing, have worked well together, and have enjoyed the creative flow of play.
      </p>
      <p>
       I presented Employee Bonuses for the second quarter of 2009 to Liz Bialobrzewski, Linda Knorr, and Angy Walker. They are nominated for this award by their colleagues.
      </p>
      <h3>
       PATRON SERVICES
      </h3>
      <p>
       Circulation of library materials increased by nearly 18% over this period in 2008. Self-check was used to check out 72% of the items. There was an impressive 15% increase in children's fiction books. Print items represent 69% of the circulation of children's materials and 43% of the adult materials. Attendance increased by 24% over last June and 19,568 "attended" our website, accessing over 98,000 pages on the site. In-library use of computers increased by 36.5% on the fourth floor, and 2.32% on the second floor.
      </p>
      <h3>
       OTHER PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES
      </h3>
      <p>
       I attended a farewell event for Tamiye Meehan, who has retired as director of the Indian Trails Public Library District on June 17, a Library Production Studio Executive Committee meeting on June 17, and a meeting of the SLURP directors on June 19. I participated in the Relay for Life activities on June 26 and attended the fundraiser for the Veterans Honor Flight program on June 30. On July 1, I represented the library at the Maine West Clinical Government class press conference and attended the Chamber of Commerce Executive Committee meeting. I attended the American Library Association's Annual Conference in Chicago from July 11 through 13. I attended the Chamber Non-Profit Networking After Hours meeting at Oakton Community College on July 14.

Sandra explained that this upgrade would incorporate mobile library cell phone and wireless service and increase the number of cell phones from 7 to 16. President Lake asked that this service be provided to only a select number of department heads because of the increased costs and Sandra Norlin responded that using this new technology was a great way for department heads to communicate with each other and to keep current with technology and requested that this proposal be postponed if not approved in its entirety.
