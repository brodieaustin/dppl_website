We are being guided through the changes and improvements by consultant Miriam Pollack. The issues we have addressed thus far are the purpose/mission of the administrative team, the time we spend on strategic planning and operational matters, the libraryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strategic plan, and what are the essential rules and the rules that are open to judgment calls at the frontline.

Although the number of registered borrowers has increased over last year at this time, it has decreased from last month. The circulation of print materials accounted for 54% of the total circulation, 69% of the Youth Services collection circulation and 47% of the Adult. Our patrons used the self-check opportunity to check out 23% of the items circulated from the main library. The Mobile Library circulation decreased by 24%, which can be partially explained by the three days the vehicle was out of service for maintenance and repair. The use of our downloadable audio book virtual collection has increased from 48 in August to 91 in September, which is a 90% increase. There were nearly 13,000 uses of our online databases, including both in-house and remote access. Our door count is down year-to-date by 6.3% and our in-house use of computers is up slightly in Adult Services and down slightly in Youth Services.            </p>            <h3>              OTHER PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES            </h3>            <p>              Two local area library issues have needed my attention this past month. One is the aftermath of the intrusion into the CCS database. There are almost daily problems for staff to struggle with, whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s slow response times, missing or erroneous report information, or unexpected format changes. As President of the CCS Governing Board I have been involved in several meetings, both real and virtual, attempting to chart the best course for a workable solution to the ongoing problems. The other issue that I am involved with as a Task Force member is the revision of the Reciprocal Borrowing Ã¢â‚¬Å“TenetsÃ¢â‚¬ for the North Suburban Library System. The new format, which is more philosophical and less procedural, has raised some questions and some complaints from the few NSLS members who have seen the revision. More work is required to clarify some of the information. The final version will be presented to the NSLS Board at the October meeting. If accepted, the document will be forwarded to all 49 library boards for approval.<br />            </p>            <p>              I attended a Trends Discussion led by Miriam Pollack on 9/22 and participated in an NSLS focus group that test drove the new website format, also on 9/22. I attended a Parliamentary Procedure workshop and the NSLS Board meeting on 9/26, the Friends of the Library meeting on 9/27, chaired the CCS Governing Board meeting on 9/28, the School Library Staff reception here on 9/29, and the Public Library AdministratorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Forum at NSLS on 10/6 and the Northbrook Public Library Art Exhibition Preview event on 10/7. I am on vacation from 10/10 through 10/16.
