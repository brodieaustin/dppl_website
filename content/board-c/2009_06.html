Overall, audio-visual materials account for 48% of the items circulated, 34% of youth materials and 56% of adult materials. In-house computer use has increased by 27% year to date.                        </p>                        <p>                            We have several ways to look at library attendance. Because our gate counters were not activated until June, we do not have an accurate account of our year to date activities. We will extrapolate a count based on the increases in items circulated because these two figures are correlated. We have counted 14,300 people who have attended programs and public meetings in the first five months of 2009 as well as 5,106 people who have attended library programs and activities provided outside the library building. Another form of â€œattendanceâ€ is virtual. Thus far in 2009, we have recorded 507,430 â€œhitsâ€ on our website. The use of our online references fluctuates. Christina Tropea has provided a brief explanation of how these statistics are provided and why they change from year to year and month to month.
