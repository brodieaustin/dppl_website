Two areas of increase were Youth and Adult Reference and Readers Advisory and meeting room attendance.<br />                            <br />                            This is the second month of our concerted efforts to encourage the use of the self-check machines by offering assistance to all patrons. In February we once again saw an increase in circulation through our self-check. This month the percent of items self-checked was 43%.<br />                            <br />                            The portion of our circulation that were print materials was 52% overall; 68% of youth services materials and 43% of adult materials checked out were print. It is worth noting that although audio and visual materials make up just 15% of our collection, they account for 48% of the items checked out.                        </p>                        <h3 style="text-align: left">                            OTHER PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES                        </h3>                        <p style="text-align: left">                            Since my last report I have attended the second meeting on Coaching for Commitment led by Mary Jane Kepner (2/21); met with Todd Wessell, editor and publisher of the Des Plaines Journal and Topics to discuss partnerships, sponsorships, and a special insert celebrating the library's centennial(3/2); attended the Des Plaines Police Department's St. Patrick's Day fundraiser; two meetings of city staff, Leopardo construction personnel, and a representative from the Firestone company to discuss the repair and possible replacement of the roof and damaged ceiling(3/5 and 3/7); the Advisory Committee of the Library Cable Television Division of the Library Production Studio(3/6); the Chamber of Commerce Board of Director's Meeting (3/8); the Oakton Community College's Cultural Sampling (3/8); the CCS Executive Committee meeting(3/14); the Library Production Studio Executive Committee meeting (3/16); and the North Suburban Library System Annual Awards Banquet (3/16).                        </p>                        <h2 style="text-align: left">                            NEW BUSINESS                        </h2>                        <p style="text-align: left">                            Gary Valente, Head of Building and Security Services, gave a brief report on the roof leaks, which have been ongoing since 2003. Gary reported that representatives from the City of Des Plaines and the Library met with a field representative from Firestone, the manufacturer of the roofing materials, and the Firestone representative made an offer to the City of Des Plaines to provide free materials to replace a portion of the roof, if the City would pay for the labor costs. Gary Valente reported that the library is owned by the City of Des Plaines and their representatives will make the decision on what offer they will accept. After the repairs or replacement of the roof is complete, the ceiling will have to be repaired. Gary explained that the sculpture, Skyword, will either be taken down or tied off before repairs can be made. Repairs will be made after regular library hours.                        </p>                        <h2 style="text-align: left">                            UNFINISHED BUSINESS                        </h2>                        <p style="text-align: left">                            The Board will change the time for their July 17, 2007 meeting to 4:00 p.m.<br />                            <br />                            <b>MOTION</b> by Rhys Read, seconded by Jerry Mahony, to change the time for the July 17, 2007 Board of Trustees meeting to 4:00 p.m. <b>VOTE</b>: AYES: All.
