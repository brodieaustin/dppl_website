We have 637 more registered borrowers than we had in March last year. The patron count is up over 8%, Interlibrary Loan is up nearly 16%, circulation of materials is up slightly over March, but is up 5.4% year to date. Youth Services print materials represent 67% of the circulation from that collection, whereas print materials circulation is 44% of the total circulation of the adult collection. The highest circulation was in DVDs from the adult collection, followed by Youth Services Fiction and Adult Non-fiction. People used Self-Check to check out 21% of the items checked out from the main library.<br />                            <br />                            Meeting Room use increased by 33.5%, thanks, no doubt, to the Friends of the Library Book sale.

This year's Conference was successful in several ways. First, it had the largest number of attendees (11,600) in its 22 year history. The location also was conducive to attending meetings and programs, because the convention center is connected to two large hotels by an indoor mall and covered walkway. And, finally, the programs were outstanding. I was able to attend eight different programs during the two and a half days that I was in Boston. Of these, three stand out for their interest and pertinence. One program was presented by the Director of the Pew Internet and American Life Project, Lee Rainie. He shared the information that his organization has collected and analyzed since 1999 about how people use the internet and how the use affects our social, political, and work lives. He described what he called the “8 Realities of the Millennials” and commented on how libraries are and will be affected by the distinct habits and characteristics of this cohort. For pure pleasure I attended “The Mysterious South” which was an interview of four current southern authors whose settings are all in the south. Margaret Maron, May Kay Andrews, Carolyn Haines, and Emyl Jenkins shared secrets of their craft and were thoroughly entertaining. I attended an update on the current status of Intellectual Freedom in libraries, post CIPA and learned that 42% of public libraries use internet filters and 37% use filters for all patrons, regardless of age. “Overcoming Silent Barriers” was a program that described what one new library director did to turn around a library's philosophy of service and image from rule- and staff-centered to user-focused. I appreciated the candor of her remarks and the ideas for getting to the layers of negativity that are not easily revealed. Finally, the closing general session was informative and entertaining. Paco Underhill, the founder of Envirosell, the marketing research firm known for its analysis of shopping behavior, demonstrated how research findings of customer behavior can/should be used to help design spaces in libraries.                        </p>                        <h2 style="text-align: left">                            UNFINISHED BUSINESS                        </h2>                        <p style="text-align: left">                            Rhys Read explained that two line items, 918070 Workers Compensation and 918085 RHS Plan Payout, were omitted from the 2006 library budget, in the amount of $8,500.00.
