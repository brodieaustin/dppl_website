      <p>
       Heather Imhoff, Head of Public Information Services, is attending the 20th Annual National Leadership Forum of the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA) in National Harbor, MD, February 9-11. Her attendance is supported by a grant through the Maine Community Youth Assistance Foundation, of which she is a member representing the library.
      </p>
      <p>
       Department Heads will participate in a joint educational session with the administrative teams of the Zion-Benton and Evanston Public Libraries on February 24. Evanston is hosting the workshop and the three libraries are sharing the costs of bringing Jamie LaRue in as our speaker and discussion facilitator. Mr. LaRue is a nationally recognized speaker on library trends and libraries&acirc;&euro;&trade; roles in their communities.

      <h3>
       PATRON SERVICES
      </h3>
      <p>
       This month&acirc;&euro;&trade;s statistical report speaks for itself. Patron use of the library is up in all areas, including the Mobile Library circulation. Total circulation increased by 19% over January 2009. Unprecedented use of the library continues. One area of use that is often overlooked is the patron use of our study rooms on the third and fourth floors. In January there were 1,186 signups for the rooms, with the highest use on the Martin Luther King Holiday of 86 separate signups during the twelve hours we were open.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Youth Services, Adult Services, Circulation Services, and Building Services staffs partnered with the District 62 schools to present Family Night at the Library on Thursday, January 28. Sixty-one adults and children attended, many of whom for the first time. All were ESL (English as a Second Language) families. We issued new library cards and gave them an opportunity to meet our library staff in several departments so that at their next visit they will see familiar faces.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our Food for Fines program was successful. We collected 2528 items for the Self-Help Closet and Food Pantry and cleared fines equal to $2528. It is interesting to see that in spite of offering to forgo fines for two weeks, we collected more money from fines than in the month of January 2009.

       February 10th is SNAPSHOT DAY at all Illinois Libraries. This is an advocacy initiative sponsored by the Illinois Library Association to call attention to the importance of libraries in the daily lives of Illinois residents. We, and all other participating libraries, will collect statistics, take photos, and solicit stories and anecdotes from our patrons on February 10 in order to create a portrait of &acirc;&euro;&oelig;one day in the life of Illinois libraries.&acirc;&euro;
