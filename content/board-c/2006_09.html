      <p>
       Several staff members attended a morning seminar on Web 2.0, the new term for the interactive use of the worldwide web. They are enthusiastically behind the plan to create a new position at the library: Web Services Librarian. This person will be responsible for continuously learning about new technological advances that are applicable and useful to public libraries; informing staff of the possibilities, coordinating the planning for introducing new services, and coordinating the implementation. We are taking advantage of a vacant position to create the new one.

       PATRON SERVICES
      </h3>
      <p>
       After last month's large increase, circulation has settled down somewhat. Print materials counted for 63% of the circulation of Children's' materials and 31% of Adult materials. Patrons used the self-check equipment to checkout 23% of the items circulated from the main library. August is the month for regular maintenance of the Mobile Library. Attendance at the library has increased by 17.3%, year to date over 2005. Meeting Room attendance also increased (9.3%).
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Computer use topped 13,000, a record for us. This was an increase of 10% over July, 2006. Use of our online reference resources increased by 5.8% with over 15 thousand searches.

       William Grice reported that the Building and Grounds Committee met on September 19, 2006 to discuss the Friends of the Library request for access to library property. The Committee consensus was to continue to have designated Friends volunteers sign in and out when working in the book storage room and to have a key to the Friends book storage room at the desk, to ask the Friends to make the book storage room safer by clearing off top shelves that are close to pipes, to have the Committee view the room after the booksale, to have volunteers wear security picture badges and to encourage volunteers for the Friends of the Library to complete health and medical history forms. The Building and Grounds Committee will meet again on October 17, 2006 at 5:30 p.m.

       Sandra Norlin introduced Hector Marino, Coordinator of Computer &amp; Technical Services, who presented a short video on RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) as it is used at the Warren Newport Library in Gurnee. Sandra Norlin explained how this technology would streamline circulation processing and be used as a new theft detection system that would replace the current 3M equipment. The cost of the system would be approximately $500,000, which Sandra Norlin proposed be added to the 2007 and 2008 budget line items.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The Board discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the RFID system and agreed to postpone making a decision on this project until discussions for the 2008 budget begin in 2007.
