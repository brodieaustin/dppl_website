My image of what is in my mind is in my paintings. I like when people look at my work and can put themselves "there" or say, "I have been there". Then I feel I have accomplished what I set out to do in my painting.                        </p>                        <p style="text-align: right">                            6/4/02                        </p>                        <div style="text-align: center" class="T10">                            <a href="/artwork/index.shtml" class="link">Artists</a> | <a href="index.shtml" class="link">Cianciarulo</a> | Biography                        </div>                    </td>                </tr>            </table>        </td>        <td width="5" height="5" background="/images/utils/feature_box_vertical.gif"></td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td class="spacer_sm">            <img src="/images/utils/feature_box_corner_BL.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />        </td>        <td width="625" height="5" nowrap="nowrap" background="/images/utils/feature_box_horizontal.gif"></td>        <td class="spacer_sm">            <img src="/images/utils/feature_box_corner_BR.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />        </td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td colspan="3" class="spacer_sm">            &nbsp;        </td>    </tr></table>
