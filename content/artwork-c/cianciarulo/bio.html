      <h2>
       Artist's Statement:
      </h2>
      <p>
       I paint early in the morning, everyday, at Cumberland School before school starts. My image of what is in my mind is in my paintings. I like when people look at my work and can put themselves "there" or say, "I have been there". Then I feel I have accomplished what I set out to do in my painting.
