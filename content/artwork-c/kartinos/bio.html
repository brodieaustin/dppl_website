Her work was featured in The Artist Magazine, Jan. 1990. She has appeared on television programs:&nbsp; Artistically Speaking and Interesting Artist and Their Unusual Work. Pioneer Press did a cover article on her.            </p>            <p align="left">              Peg has had numerous commissions and her work is found in many public and private collections. Her work has won many awards. Her demonstrations in schools, art supply stores and art league meetings are always well received. Many galleries have featured Peg&#39;s work in one person and collective shows. At present she is represented by Copper Frog Galler in Long Grove, IL.&nbsp;            </p>            <div align="center">              <center>                <table border="0" width="90%">                  <tr>                    <td width="21%" valign="top">                      <b>Affiliations:</b>                    </td>                    <td width="79%">                      Park Ridge Art League<br />                      Des Plaines Art Guild<br />                      Elk Grove Artists Association<br />                      Skokie Art Guild<br />                      Illinois Watercolor Society<br />                      Windy City Artists<br />                      Glenview Art League<br />                      Wilmette Art Guild<br />                      Northwest Cultural Council                    </td>                  </tr>                </table>              </center>            </div>            <h2>              Artist&#39;s statement            </h2>            <p align="left">              My reverence for nature dominates my life, and painting is a way of expressing that feeling.
