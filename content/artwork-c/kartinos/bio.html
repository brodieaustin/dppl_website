       Peg has developed an unique process for creating bird portraits (the results are so realistic that she has been accused many times of killing birds for their feathers) and semi-abstract feather designs; all of which reflect her love for birds, their colors and patterns. Her work was featured in The Artist Magazine, Jan. 1990. She has appeared on television programs:&nbsp; Artistically Speaking and Interesting Artist and Their Unusual Work. Pioneer Press did a cover article on her.

       Artist's statement
      </h2>
      <p style="text-align: left">
       My reverence for nature dominates my life, and painting is a way of expressing that feeling. I paint because I have compulsion to create. When working in my studio, I lose myself and feel in touch with the universal creative process.
