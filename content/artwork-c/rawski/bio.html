She has studied with several Chinese teachers during the last 10 years. She uses a wide range of colors, and her work is done with Chinese watercolors made with natural roots and minerals. The silk, the colors, and the brushes come from Hong Kong.                        </p>                        <p>                            Rawski paints mainly landscapes, birds, flowers, and butterflies.
