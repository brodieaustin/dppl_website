Bonnivier's paintings are impressionistic; an emotion, a fleeting glance, or a nuance of color can best explain them. The artist feels no need "to say it all", and would rather the viewers bring something of themselves to the work.                        </p>                        <p>                            Bonnivier was born in Chicago, but recently moved to the "quiet side" of Door County to be closer to the nature that she loves. She has traveled extensively, and sketched and painted all over Europe, the Bahamas, Hawaii, and most of the United States. In these travels, the artist has seen unique and dramatic vistas. She believes, as it says in the Psalms, "Though we travel the world over to find the beautiful, we must carry it with us or we will find it not". She continually returns to her favorite subjects, the wildflowers and weeds of the Midwest, and the tranquil views of small towns, lakes, and woods.                        </p>                        <p>                            Though she has studied art for years and is degreed, most of Bonnivier's techniques are innovative and self-taught. Her use of oil pastel and oil on rag or rice paper with elements of collage is a unique method. She often combines monoprinting and the use of stencils and brayers to give a print-like appearance to the work. As an artist she feels, as Renoir did, that “the world is filled with enough disagreeable things without an artist contriving still more of them.”                        </p>                        <p style="text-align: right">                            1/7/02                        </p>                        <div style="text-align: center" class="T10">                            <a href="/artwork/index.shtml" class="link">Artists</a> | <a href="index.shtml" class="link">Bonnivier</a> | Biography<br />                            <br />                        </div>                    </td>                </tr>            </table>        </td>        <td width="5" height="5" background="/images/utils/feature_box_vertical.gif"></td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td class="spacer_sm">            <img src="/images/utils/feature_box_corner_BL.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />        </td>        <td width="625" height="5" nowrap="nowrap" background="/images/utils/feature_box_horizontal.gif"></td>        <td class="spacer_sm">            <img src="/images/utils/feature_box_corner_BR.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />        </td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td colspan="3" class="spacer_sm">            &nbsp;        </td>    </tr></table>
