All the paints are rated permanent and lightfast. My paintings are not produced by a formula process. Sometimes they are planned in an organized manner: a sketch, first wash, second wash, and lastly, detail. There are occasions, when color is applied spontaneously and the painting emerges. Both processes have helped my growth as an artist.                        </p>                        <p>                            My wildlife, still-life, and landscape paintings are filled with the rich color which has become my trademark. The subjects I choose are familiar objects, places, and people. All of my paintings are original concepts. My still-lifes are either painted from life, or I use photographs that I have shot for reference material. Usually I paint a series of paintings, i.e., American Flag, Patio scenes, Vegetables, Fruits, Landscapes.                        </p>                        <div style="text-align: center" class="T10">                            <a href="/artwork/index.shtml" class="link">Artists</a> | <a href="index.shtml" class="link">Farrell</a> | Biography<br />                            <br />                        </div>                    </td>                </tr>            </table>        </td>        <td width="5" height="5" background="/images/utils/feature_box_vertical.gif"></td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td class="spacer_sm">            <img src="/images/utils/feature_box_corner_BL.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />        </td>        <td width="625" height="5" nowrap="nowrap" background="/images/utils/feature_box_horizontal.gif"></td>        <td class="spacer_sm">            <img src="/images/utils/feature_box_corner_BR.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />        </td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td colspan="3" class="spacer_sm">            &nbsp;        </td>    </tr></table>
