She wants to share her love of nature and her love for painting with those who love and appreciate what God has given to us. She is not concerned with recording the obvious vocabulary of nature; rather to tune into nature&#39;s magical subtleties and create an experience, painting the memory of her feelings. Because she expresses her feelings along with what her eyes sees, her work sometimes takes on an abstract quality - not surprising, since she is a storyteller, not a reporter.&nbsp;            </p>            <p>              The work of Thelma Cornell Spain draws the viewer into a sense of mystery that permeates her paintings, embodying a mixture of happiness, beauty, sadness, and love that gives life to a moment that would escape the sharpest camera lens. Dunes, shorelines, and land/seascapes are recurring themes captured from the New Jersey, Maine, and Nova Scotia coastlines she loves so well.&nbsp;            </p>            <div align="center" class="T10">              <a href="/artwork/index.shtml" class="link">Artists</a> | <a href="index.shtml" class="link">Spain</a> | Biography<br />              <br />            </div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>    </td>    <td width="5" height="5" background="/images/utils/feature_box_vertical.gif"></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td class="spacer_sm">      <img src="/images/utils/feature_box_corner_BL.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />    </td>    <td width="625" height="5" nowrap="nowrap" background="/images/utils/feature_box_horizontal.gif"></td>    <td class="spacer_sm">      <img src="/images/utils/feature_box_corner_BR.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td colspan="3" class="spacer_sm">      &nbsp;    </td>  </tr></table>
