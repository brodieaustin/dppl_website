I drew sketches of my teachers and fellow students as early as 3rd grade and was encouraged to attend group classes at the Art Institute of Chicago by being given a scholarship in 7th grade.                        </p>                        <p>                            My subject matter ranges from landscapes to people enjoying flowers or a sunset -- whatever I see that inspires me to try to capture a moment of light and shadow or the remembrance of things past. I have been described as a romantic impressionist. I see myself as wanting to record beauty - perhaps the light dancing across a flower or flesh, but always to make people see the beauty in life.                        </p>                        <p>                            My paintings are done mostly on sandpaper, with some done on pastel paper, board or Wallis paper. Pastels are pigment in a stick form, the same pigment used to make watercolor or oil. They are extremely permanent when protected by glass. The technique I use is mainly the stroking of pastel in numerous layers so that many colors show through, creating a myriad of hues.                        </p>                        <p>                            My ideas come from watching nature and by setting up scenes for figures, complete with clothing and props, and then photographing them. From the hundreds of prints I have, I choose several and create a unique design, which I then use as the starting point of my painting. I feel that to create a thing of beauty is indeed a joy forever.                        </p>                        <div style="text-align: center" class="T10">                            <a href="/artwork/index.shtml" class="link">Artists</a> | <a href="index.shtml" class="link">Solarz</a> | Biography<br />                            <br />                        </div>                    </td>                </tr>            </table>        </td>        <td width="5" height="5" background="/images/utils/feature_box_vertical.gif"></td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td class="spacer_sm">            <img src="/images/utils/feature_box_corner_BL.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />        </td>        <td width="625" height="5" nowrap="nowrap" background="/images/utils/feature_box_horizontal.gif"></td>        <td class="spacer_sm">            <img src="/images/utils/feature_box_corner_BR.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />        </td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td colspan="3" class="spacer_sm">            &nbsp;        </td>    </tr></table>
