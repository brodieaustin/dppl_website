       Artist's statement
      </h2>
      <p>
       My love of art started at a very young age with drawing things around me, especially people. I drew sketches of my teachers and fellow students as early as 3rd grade and was encouraged to attend group classes at the Art Institute of Chicago by being given a scholarship in 7th grade.
      </p>
      <p>
       My subject matter ranges from landscapes to people enjoying flowers or a sunset -- whatever I see that inspires me to try to capture a moment of light and shadow or the remembrance of things past. I have been described as a romantic impressionist. I see myself as wanting to record beauty - perhaps the light dancing across a flower or flesh, but always to make people see the beauty in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       My paintings are done mostly on sandpaper, with some done on pastel paper, board or Wallis paper. Pastels are pigment in a stick form, the same pigment used to make watercolor or oil. They are extremely permanent when protected by glass. The technique I use is mainly the stroking of pastel in numerous layers so that many colors show through, creating a myriad of hues.
      </p>
      <p>
       My ideas come from watching nature and by setting up scenes for figures, complete with clothing and props, and then photographing them. From the hundreds of prints I have, I choose several and create a unique design, which I then use as the starting point of my painting. I feel that to create a thing of beauty is indeed a joy forever.
