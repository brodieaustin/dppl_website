I like a piece of work that doesn't bore the viewer after the second look. Sometimes I use real flowers or weeds found in the woods, or glitter, metallic paint or whatever as an additional surprise. Some of my pieces are called "beautiful" or "pretty" and tend to make people smile and feel good. For those comments and feelings, I offer no apology, but take delight.&nbsp;                        </p>                        <div style="text-align: center" class="T10">                            <a href="/artwork/index.shtml" class="link">Artists</a> | <a href="index.shtml" class="link">Monaghan</a> | Biography<br />                            <br />                        </div>                    </td>                </tr>            </table>        </td>        <td width="5" height="5" background="/images/utils/feature_box_vertical.gif"></td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td class="spacer_sm">            <img src="/images/utils/feature_box_corner_BL.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />        </td>        <td width="625" height="5" nowrap="nowrap" background="/images/utils/feature_box_horizontal.gif"></td>        <td class="spacer_sm">            <img src="/images/utils/feature_box_corner_BR.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />        </td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td colspan="3" class="spacer_sm">            &nbsp;        </td>    </tr></table>
