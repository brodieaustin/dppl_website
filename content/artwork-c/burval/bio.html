Burval, TWSA, WHS was trained in art and education at Northern Illinois University and has concentrated her studies in watercolors since 1991. You can sense her creative passion through her use of this dynamic, fluid medium. Her watercolor paintings have received numerous ribbons and awards and are included in many public and private collections. Many of her works are painted on location. She recently became a Signature Member of Midwest Watercolor Society. She teaches watercolor in Barrington and Palatine at two private art schools.            </p>            <h2>              Artist&#39;s statement            </h2>            <p>              &quot;In a world that contains so much pain and suffering, I believe our inner spirits are seeking to understand the fragile life that surrounds us each day, hoping for understanding and peace. If each of us can embrace another with our vision, our words, our personal gleam of hope, a harmony of our inner spirits will be created. Each moment in our lives is a gift to be cherished and I strive to enhance the perceptions of those who may have a difficult time seeing any beauty at all within their lives. My vision is to promote the value of artistic expression as a healing tool for the troubled soul. Healing for the raging bull in our heads, peace for our inner spirit. God&#39;s gift of creativity to me, I now offer to you.&quot;            </p>            <div align="center" class="T10">              <a href="/artwork/index.shtml" class="link">Artists</a> | <a href="index.shtml" class="link">Burval</a> | Biography<br />              <br />            </div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>    </td>    <td width="5" height="5" background="/images/utils/feature_box_vertical.gif"></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td class="spacer_sm">      <img src="/images/utils/feature_box_corner_BL.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />    </td>    <td width="625" height="5" nowrap="nowrap" background="/images/utils/feature_box_horizontal.gif"></td>    <td class="spacer_sm">      <img src="/images/utils/feature_box_corner_BR.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td colspan="3" class="spacer_sm">      &nbsp;    </td>  </tr></table>
