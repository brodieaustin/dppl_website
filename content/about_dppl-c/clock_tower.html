          When the Des Plaines Public Library opened its doors on Graceland Avenue in 1958, a clock tower perched atop the Colonial Williamsburg-style building let patrons know they had found the library. That clock tower became the recognized symbol of the library and served as its logo for many years.

          The freestanding clock tower in Library Plaza carries on the tradition of a library clock tower. Notice the uniqueness of the face on the new clock.
