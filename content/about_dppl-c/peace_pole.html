Friends and supporters of the project have dedicated over 200,000 peace poles in 180 countries around the world. Peace poles have been planted in such diverse sites as Gorky Park, the Pyramids of El Giza, and the Magnetic North Pole. People from all walks of life have dedicated Peace Poles. They include former President Jimmy Carter, former Pope John Paul II, the Dalai Lama, and folk singer John Denver.<br />                            <br />                        </p>                        <h2>                            Library Peace Pole Dedication                        </h2>                        <p>                            The peace pole was dedicated on the library plaza on September 30, 2001, during the first anniversary celebration for the current building.
