      The Des Plaines Public Library stands in the heart of downtown Des Plaines, offering not only a tremendous array of library materials and services to its patrons, but also a beautiful and welcoming space in which to enjoy the library's offerings. The Library building is a visual and architectural focal point in downtown Des Plaines and an important anchor in the city's downtown redevelopment plans. The interior of the library is warm and colorful, with plenty of natural light and original works of art to stimulate the imagination. The Library provides quiet space for reading, study and reflection, as well as active spaces for public meetings, children's activities and musical performances.

      A visitor once observed that the Des Plaines Public Library reminded him how important it is for public buildings to "inspire." Fine art in public places nurtures a community's creative expression. Public art can provide beauty, comfort, serenity, playfulness and mindfulness.

      The Des Plaines Public Library has numerous works of art for the public to enjoy. The Board of Trustees selected a variety of art forms to illustrate the three goals of the library's programs: literacy, lifelong learning and the love of reading. All of the artwork is funded by donations.
