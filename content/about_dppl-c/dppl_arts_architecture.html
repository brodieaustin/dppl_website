The Library building is a visual and architectural focal point in downtown Des Plaines and an important anchor in the city's downtown redevelopment plans. The interior of the library is warm and colorful, with plenty of natural light and original works of art to stimulate the imagination. The Library provides quiet space for reading, study and reflection, as well as active spaces for public meetings, children's activities and musical performances.<br />                        <br />                        <img src="../images/about_dppl/YSmural.jpg" border="1" align="left" alt="Photograph of one portion of the acrylic mural on the south wall of the Youth Services department - scene depicts various children's story book characters next to a river" width="216" height="162" /><br />                        <br />                        A visitor once observed that the Des Plaines Public Library reminded him how important it is for public buildings to "inspire."
