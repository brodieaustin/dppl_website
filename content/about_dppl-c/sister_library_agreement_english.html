       In the spirit of international cooperation among libraries and, for the development of services and information professionals under the auspices of the (American Library Association) Sister Libraries program, the above institutions agree to formalize a specific agreement of collaboration for their mutual benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The objectives of this collaboration are:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        To demonstrate the importance and benefits of international library cooperation between Mexico and the United States of America.
       </li>
       <li>
        To promote cooperation and the exchange of ideas among librarians for solutions to common challenges.
       </li>
       <li>
        To raise awareness among librarians of the issues facing public libraries of both countries.
       </li>
       <li>
        To create opportunities for learning and understanding in the libraries by learning and understanding the users who come from other parts of the world, in this case, Mexico and the United States of America.
       </li>
       <li>
        To share techniques and technologies to help solve problems.
       </li>
       <li>
        To provide resources and training to strengthen library institutions
       </li>
       <li>
        To increase the different kinds of interactions among the librarians.
       </li>
       <li>
        To share information resources to support the different information needs of the librarians and users.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Both institutions will look for joint opportunities of financing to support their objectives, in government institutions, non-government institutions, civil associations, cooperative programs between the United States of North America and Mexico, and sources from the private sector.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, any expense made prior to the signature of the agreement will be the sole responsibility of each institution.
