         The Poet Tree Corner features a tree built out from the northeast corner of the second floor. Inside, there is room for a child to sit and read or write. The area also includes an interactive magnetic poetry board and a stage with levels for performing or reading. All are set against a backdrop of river and sky. In addition, the children's poetry books have been relocated to the Poet Tree Corner.
