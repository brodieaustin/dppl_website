If you need Adobe Acrobat Reader, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html" class="link">download it free</a>.                        </p>                        <p>                            The list is in alphabetical order by the inscription on the brick. If the first word of the inscription is "a" or "the," it has been ignored for alphabetizing.&nbsp;                        </p>                        <p>                            Click on the binoculars to start your search. Enter your inscription in the first text box. If you can't remember the exact inscription, chose a unique word from the inscription to use as your "keyword" and search on that word. Click on Search. If more than one inscription contains your keyword, all of these inscriptions will appear. Scroll down the list and click on your own inscription to find your brick location.                        </p>                        <p>                            Once you have found your inscription, take note of the location in the second column. "P" stands for pillar and "FD" is front door. Face the library building, and start counting the pillars from left to right (1 through 9)&nbsp; to find the general location of your brick. For example, P3 means your brick is in the area in front of the third pillar from the left. FP (which is not on the image) means your brick is by the flag pole.                        </p>                        <p>                            <a href="BrickAlphaList.pdf" class="link">Alphabetic Brick Inscriptions</a>                        </p>                        <p style="text-align: center">                            <img border="1" src="../images/about_dppl/BrickPillars.jpg" width="528" height="156" /><br />                            <br />                        </p><!-- CONTENT BODY END -->                    </td>                </tr>            </table>        </td>        <td width="5" height="5" background="../images/utils/feature_box_vertical.gif"></td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td class="spacer_sm">            <img src="../images/utils/feature_box_corner_BL.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />        </td>        <td width="625" height="5" nowrap="nowrap" background="../images/utils/feature_box_horizontal.gif"></td>        <td class="spacer_sm">            <img src="../images/utils/feature_box_corner_BR.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />        </td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td colspan="3" class="spacer_sm">            &nbsp;        </td>    </tr></table>
