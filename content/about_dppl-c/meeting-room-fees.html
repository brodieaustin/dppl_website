<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>At the January 2013 meeting of the Library Board of Trustees meeting, board members voted to begin charging a $15 fee for DPPL public meeting room use. Trustees feel this fee is in line with those charged by other area libraries and is necessary to expand DPPLâ€™s stream of non-tax funded revenue.</p>
