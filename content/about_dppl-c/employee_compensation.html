   In 2011,
   <a class="link" href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=097-0609&amp;GA=97">
    Illinois Public Act 97-0609
   </a>
   became law, effective January 1, 2012. That Act amends the Illinois Open Meetings Act and the Illinois Pension Code and establishes new requirements for Illinois public bodies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among the law's requirements are the following:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    All IMRF employers must post, within 6 days of the approval of a budget, the total compensation package for each employee having a total compensation package that exceeds $75,000 per year.
   </li>
   <li>
    Any IMRF employer that approves an employee's total compensation package equal to or in excess of $150,000 per year must post on its website, at least 6 days before the approval, the total compensation package for that employee.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   "Total compensation package" for purposes of the Act means "payment by the employer to the employee for salary, health insurance, a housing allowance, a vehicle allowance, a clothing allowance, bonuses, loans, vacation days granted, and sick days granted."
  </p>
  <p>
   The Des Plaines Public Library has elected to provide employee compensation information for all of its employees regardless of salary level.
