			<p>In 2011, <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=097-0609&GA=97" class="link">Illinois Public Act 97-0609</a> became law, effective January 1, 2012. That Act amends the Illinois Open Meetings Act and the Illinois Pension Code and establishes new requirements for Illinois public bodies. </p>
			<p>Among the law’s requirements are the following:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>All IMRF employers must post, within 6 days of the approval of a budget, the total compensation package for each employee having a total compensation package that exceeds $75,000 per year.</li>
			<li>Any IMRF employer that approves an employee’s total compensation package equal to or in excess of $150,000 per year must post on its website, at least 6 days before the approval, the total compensation package for that employee.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>"Total compensation package" for purposes of the Act means "payment by the employer to the employee for salary, health insurance, a housing allowance, a vehicle allowance, a clothing allowance, bonuses, loans, vacation days granted, and sick days granted." </p>
			<p>The Des Plaines Public Library has elected to provide employee compensation information for all of its employees regardless of salary level. </p>
