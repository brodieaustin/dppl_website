       In 2011,
       <a class="link" href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=097-0609&amp;GA=97">
        Illinois Public Act 97-0609
       </a>
       became law, effective January 1, 2012. That Act amends the Illinois Open Meetings Act and the Illinois Pension Code and establishes new requirements for Illinois public bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Among the law's requirements are the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        All IMRF employers must post, within 6 days of the approval of a budget, the total compensation package for each employee having a total compensation package that exceeds $75,000 per year.
       </li>
       <li>
        Any IMRF employer that approves an employee's total compensation package equal to or in excess of $150,000 per year must post on its website, at least 6 days before the approval, the total compensation package for that employee.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       "Total compensation package" for purposes of the Act means "payment by the employer to the employee for salary, health insurance, a housing allowance, a vehicle allowance, a clothing allowance, bonuses, loans, vacation days granted, and sick days granted."
      </p>
      <p>
       The Des Plaines Public Library has elected to provide employee compensation information for all of its employees regardless of salary level.
