They wanted to give a gift to the library to commemorate this special occasion. While considering what kind of gift to give, they were introduced to designer Glenn Rebechini of Rebechini Studios, Inc. in Elk Grove Village.&nbsp;            </p>            <p>              He showed them a 27-inch ceramic sculpture of young Abraham Lincoln with a book in his hand and a dog lying at his feet. The sculpture was created by RebechiniÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s grandfather, Guido Rebechini, who had displayed it at the 1933 Century of Progress WorldÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Fair.&nbsp;            </p>            <p>              The Friends conferred with the Library Board, the libraryÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s art consultant, and the library administration. They decided to purchase the sculpture, have it bronzed, and present it to the library. Rebechini suggested that the lost wax process be used. A wax mold is made from the original and bronze is poured into the mold, creating a duplicate in bronze while keeping the original intact.&nbsp;            </p>            <p>              The bronze statue ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Young Lincoln LearningÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ was dedicated on May 21, 2004 during the Friends 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebration. It is permanently housed on the first floor of the library.            </p>            <div align="center">              <a href="dppl_artwork.shtml" class="link_sm">Building artwork index</a> | <a href="dppl_artwork_LincolnSculpture.shtml" class="link_sm">Abraham Lincoln Sculpture</a> | <a href="dppl_artwork_Sculpture.shtml" class="link_sm">Atrium Sky Word Sculpture</a><br />              <a href="dppl_artwork_Mural4thFloor.shtml" class="link_sm">Fourth Floor Mural</a> | <a href="dppl_artwork_MultiMediaSculpture.shtml" class="link_sm">Mixed Media Sculpture - Second Floor</a> | <a href="dppl_artwork_PoetTreeDedication.shtml" class="link_sm">Poet Tree Corner</a><br />              <a href="dppl_artwork_Mural2ndFloor.shtml" class="link_sm">Second Floor Childrens&#39; Mural</a> | <a href="dppl_artwork_STRoomMuralFinal.shtml" class="link_sm">Storytime Mural</a> | <a href="dppl_artwork_Mural3rdFloor.shtml" class="link_sm">Third Floor Computer-Generated Mural</a>            </div>          </td>        </tr>      </table>    </td>    <td width="5" height="5" background="../images/utils/feature_box_vertical.gif"></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td class="spacer_sm">      <img src="../images/utils/feature_box_corner_BL.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />    </td>    <td width="625" height="5" nowrap="nowrap" background="../images/utils/feature_box_horizontal.gif"></td>    <td class="spacer_sm">      <img src="../images/utils/feature_box_corner_BR.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td colspan="3" class="spacer_sm">      &nbsp;    </td>  </tr></table>
