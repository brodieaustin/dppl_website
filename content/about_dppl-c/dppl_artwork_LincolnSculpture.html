       In Spring 2004, Friends of the Library celebrated their 50
       <sup>
        th
       </sup>
       anniversary. They wanted to give a gift to the library to commemorate this special occasion. While considering what kind of gift to give, they were introduced to designer Glenn Rebechini of Rebechini Studios, Inc. in Elk Grove Village.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       He showed them a 27-inch ceramic sculpture of young Abraham Lincoln with a book in his hand and a dog lying at his feet. The sculpture was created by Rebechini&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;s grandfather, Guido Rebechini, who had displayed it at the 1933 Century of Progress World&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;s Fair.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       The Friends conferred with the Library Board, the library&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;s art consultant, and the library administration. They decided to purchase the sculpture, have it bronzed, and present it to the library. Rebechini suggested that the lost wax process be used. A wax mold is made from the original and bronze is poured into the mold, creating a duplicate in bronze while keeping the original intact.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       The bronze statue &iuml;&iquest;&frac12;Young Lincoln Learning&iuml;&iquest;&frac12; was dedicated on May 21, 2004 during the Friends 50
       <sup>
        th
       </sup>
       anniversary celebration. It is permanently housed on the first floor of the library.
