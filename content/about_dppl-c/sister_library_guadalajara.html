It is the capital of the state of Jalisco. Guadalajara has a rich history dating back to Mexico's days as a Spanish colony. The city was founded in 1531 by Nuno de Guzman, a Spanish conquistador, who named Guadalajara for his birthplace back in Spain.                        </p>                        <p>                            Guadalajara is considered by many to be the most Mexican of cities, known for its beauty and its significant cultural contributions. The city is affectionately nicknamed both <i>La Perla del Occidente</i> ("the pearl of the west") and <i>Ciudad de las Rosas</i> ("city of roses") and is admired for its Colonial architecture, public squares, parks and churches. It is believed that mariachi music, a particular genre featuring vocals, guitars, trumpets and violins, originated in the state of Jalisco. Guadalajara is considered home of the <i>jarabe tapat?o</i>, sometimes called the "Mexican hat dance" and some say the city is the birthplace of the sombrero itself. Until the late 1800s, the haciendas and ranches of Jalisco were worked by cowboys known as <i>charros</i> and this tradition continues today in the form of colorfully dressed, skillful riders and ropers who perform in rodeos, or <i>charreadas</i>. Tequila was invented in the region and Jalisco is home to Mexico's modern tequila industry. Today, Guadalajara is an important manufacturing center, known for its fine pottery and blown glass along with the production of textiles, hosiery, flour, steel and alcoholic products.<br />                            <br />                            Guadalajara is also home to the <a href="http://www.udg.mx/" class="link">University of Guadalajara</a>. The University's vivid history dates back to 1792. Biblioteca Benjam&iacute;n Franklin is located on the campus of the University of Guadalajara.<br />                        </p>                        <p>                            <b>Jalisco</b> is one of 31 states (along with the Federal District, located in Mexico City) in the federal republic of Mexico (<i>Estados Unidos Mexicanos</i>).
