         The Youth Services Department on the second floor is designed to introduce very young children to the joys of stories, the magic of poetry, and the creative process involving words. Artist Robert Jessup used acrylic paint to create this colorful, textural 80-foot mural, which invites children of all ages to touch and explore.
