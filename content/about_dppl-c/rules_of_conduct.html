        The Board of Trustees of the Des Plaines Public Library believes that all people have the right to use the materials, services, and facilities of the Library without disruption from others. Patrons and staff also have the right to a secure and comfortable environment. The following Rules of Conduct have been established to maintain these rights:
       </p>

This includes, but is not limited to, extended loud or unusual noises, indecent behavior, offensive or unbecoming conduct or language, blocking the stairways or entrance or exits, and verbal or physical harassment.
       </p>
       <p>
        2. Viewing Internet images that display nudity in a sexual context or sexual activity is prohibited.
       </p>
       <p>
        3. Smoking is prohibited in all areas of the Library building.
       </p>
       <p>
        4. Beverages in covered containers are welcome in the library. Eating is prohibited in public areas, except for meeting rooms.
       </p>
       <p>
        5. Animals, except those used to aid persons with disabilities, are not permitted in the Library.
       </p>

       </p>
