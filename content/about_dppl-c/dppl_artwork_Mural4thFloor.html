The themes he used to create this sculpture include alphabets, punctuations, scrivener's tools, and fruit. “The library,” Nagelbach says, “is a repository of the fruits of the mind.” The materials are wood, steel, aluminum, and bronze.                                            </p>                                            <p style="text-align: left">                                                Nagelbach was born in Liebling, Banat, Romania. He earned a B.A. Degree in geography from Valparaiso University and an M.F.A. Degree in sculpture from Rhode Island School of Design. He was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to study in Germany, where he earned a Certifikat from the Akademie der Bildende Künste, München. Nagelbach's work has been featured in numerous exhibitions and is included in many collections. Currently, he teaches at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.                                            </p>                                        </blockquote>                                    </td>                                </tr>                            </table>                            <div style="text-align: center">                                <a href="dppl_artwork.shtml" class="link_sm">Building artwork index</a> | <a href="dppl_artwork_LincolnSculpture.shtml" class="link_sm">Abraham Lincoln Sculpture</a> | <a href="dppl_artwork_Sculpture.shtml" class="link_sm">Atrium Sky Word Sculpture</a><br />                                <a href="dppl_artwork_Mural4thFloor.shtml" class="link_sm">Fourth Floor Mural</a> | <a href="dppl_artwork_MultiMediaSculpture.shtml" class="link_sm">Mixed Media Sculpture - Second Floor</a> | <a href="dppl_artwork_PoetTreeDedication.shtml" class="link_sm">Poet Tree Corner</a><br />                                <a href="dppl_artwork_Mural2ndFloor.shtml" class="link_sm">Second Floor Childrens' Mural</a> | <a href="dppl_artwork_STRoomMuralFinal.shtml" class="link_sm">Storytime Mural</a> | <a href="dppl_artwork_Mural3rdFloor.shtml" class="link_sm">Third Floor Computer-Generated Mural</a>                            </div><!-- CONTENT END -->                        </div>                    </td>                </tr>            </table>        </td>        <td width="5" height="5" background="../images/utils/feature_box_vertical.gif"></td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td class="spacer_sm">            <img src="../images/utils/feature_box_corner_BL.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />        </td>        <td width="625" height="5" nowrap="nowrap" background="../images/utils/feature_box_horizontal.gif"></td>        <td class="spacer_sm">            <img src="../images/utils/feature_box_corner_BR.gif" width="5" height="5" border="0" alt="" />        </td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td colspan="3" class="spacer_sm">            &nbsp;        </td>    </tr></table>
