The outdoor museum &lsquo;collects&rsquo; and reassembles buildings that represent different periods in Japan's history.

Light filtering through giant coastal redwoods, grand vistas on Mount Tamalpais, and waves crashing onto rocky beaches are breathtaking to see.

The Milwaukee Public Museum and the Miklwaukee Art Museum (pictured) are standouts in their own regard.&rdquo;",
